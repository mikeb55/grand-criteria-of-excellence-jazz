# GCE Jazz Transformation Log
## Project: Wonderland V3.1 -> "Ornithology in Orbit" (The Parker/Shorter/Scofield Summit)

**Original Format:** Orchestral (Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Horns, Strings)
**Original Time:** 9/8 (Compound Triple)

### The Concept: "Ornithology in Orbit"
This transformation imagines a hypothetical studio session featuring:
*   **Charlie Parker (Alto Sax):** Providing rapid-fire bebop lines, double-time feel, and chromatic enclosures.
*   **Wayne Shorter (Tenor Sax/Soprano):** Contributing modal spaciousness, non-functional harmony, and cryptic melodic fragments.
*   **John Scofield (Guitar):** Adding angular funk-fusion comping, behind-the-beat phrasing, and altered dominant tension.

### GCE Hybrid Protocol Application

#### 1. Rhythmic & Formal Structure
*   **Groove:** We abandon the strict 9/8 for a loose, post-bop **Swing** that occasionally breaks into a straight-eighth **Fusion Funk** feel (Scofield influence).
*   **Tempo:** Up-tempo (Bebop energy), but with "floaty" sections (Shorter influence).

#### 2. Instrumentation & Role Assignment
*   **Voice 1 (Alto Sax - Parker):** Takes the rapid melodic runs. The original 8th notes in the 9/8 bar become bebop 8th-note triplets or double-time runs.
*   **Voice 2 (Tenor Sax - Shorter):** Plays harmony parts that move in parallel fourths or provides counter-melodies with long sustain.
*   **Voice 3 (Guitar - Scofield):** Provides the harmonic bed—crunchy, dissonant clusters (seconds/minor ninths) and syncopated comping stabs.
*   **Bass/Drums:** Walking bass with "broken" time feel (Elvin Jones/Tony Williams style).

#### 3. Harmonic Transformation
*   **The "Parker" Change:** Diatonic major lines are re-harmonized with **Tritone Substitutions** and **ii-V-I** chains.
    *   *Original:* C - E - G (C Major)
    *   *New:* Gm7 - C7(b9) - Fmaj7 (Bird changes).
*   **The "Shorter" Twist:** Unexpected root movements (e.g., C Major to Db Lydian).
*   **The "Scofield" Edge:** Dominant chords are altered (Alt) and voicings are sparse.
