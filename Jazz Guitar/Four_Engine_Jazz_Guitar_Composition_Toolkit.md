# Four Engine Jazz Guitar Composition Toolkit

This toolkit contains four specialized engines for generating jazz guitar compositions, etudes, and reharmonizations within Cursor.ai. It is designed to produce professional-level, guitaristic output based on melody-driven harmony, triad pairs, and counterpoint.

## Core Philosophy
All engines operate under the **Unified Composition System**:
*   **Melody-Driven Harmony:** Melody dictates the harmonic universe (harmonize downward).
*   **Modal Interchange:** Multiple options for every melody tone.
*   **Triad-Pair Tonality:** One stable triad + one color/tension triad per chord.
*   **Barry Harris Logic:** Stable/unstable tones & diminished connectors.
*   **Jimmy Wyble Counterpoint:** Two independent voices with contrary/oblique motion.
*   **Guitaristic Design:** Idiomatic writing for strings 2-4, mid-neck positions.
*   **Structural Clarity:** Adherence to standard forms (AABA, ABAC, etc.).
*   **Evaluation:** All output is checked against the 10 Criteria of Excellence.

## How to Use
1.  **Select an Engine:** Decide which output you need (Etude, Arrangement, Song, or Line).
2.  **Type the Trigger:** Start your prompt with the specific keyword (e.g., "Etude: minor 2-5-1").
3.  **Refine:** If the output needs adjustment, ask the engine to "Revise based on Criterion X" (e.g., "Revise for better voice leading").

## Installation
Copy the **Combined 4-Engine Prompt** into your Cursor.ai system instructions or use it as a preamble for your composition session.
