|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
| F Major (Lydian) | Through-composed | 3/4 | 16 | Wayne Shorter (Post-1965 Avant-Garde) | Wayne Shorter |

**Uniqueness Tagline:** Chromatic free-fall through Lydian plateaus — a waltz that never lands.  
**Playing Tip:** Let the phrases breathe across bar lines; silence is your co-pilot.  
**Analysis Focus:** Non-functional chromatic root motion with Lydian predominance.  
**Practice Priority:** Smooth voice leading through distant key centers.

## **5. TWO-VOICE COUNTERPOINT BREAKDOWN (Wyble)**

### Bars 1–4: Contrary Motion
```
Top Line:    F5 → Eb5 → Db5 → B4
Bottom Line: F3 → G3  → Ab3 → A3
Motion:      Contrary — voices move in opposite directions
Comment:     Top descends chromatically; bass rises creating maximum voice separation.
```

### Bars 5–8: Oblique Motion
```
Top Line:    Bb4 → Ab4 → Gb4 → E4
Bottom Line: Bb2 → Bb2 → Bb2 → E3
Motion:      Oblique — bottom voice holds then leaps
Comment:     Top voice continues chromatic descent; bass anchors then jumps a tritone.
```

### Bars 9–12: Contrary Motion
```
Top Line:    F4  → F4  → A4  → G4
Bottom Line: F3  → Db3 → A2  → G2
Motion:      Contrary — convergence then divergence
Comment:     Voices contract inward then expand outward dramatically.
```

### Bars 13–16: Contrary Resolution
```
Top Line:    F5 → Eb5 → Db5 → F5
Bottom Line: F2 → Eb3 → Db3 → F3
Motion:      Parallel octaves, then contrary resolution
Comment:     Final resolution uses parallel motion to return home with authority.
```

## **REFERENCES**

**Influences:**
- Wayne Shorter: *Speak No Evil* (1964), *JuJu* (1964), *Nefertiti* (1967)

**Key Characteristics:**
- No V-I cadences — harmony never resolves functionally
- Chromatic root motion — roots move by half-step, not by fifth
- Major 7th predominance — almost all chords are maj7 variants
- Lydian as default — ♯11 creates floating, unresolved quality
- Color over function — chords relate by sound color, not tension-release
