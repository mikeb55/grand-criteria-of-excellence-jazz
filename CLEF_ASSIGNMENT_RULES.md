# Clef Assignment Rules for Piano Grand Staff (MusicXML > Sibelius)

1. On piano grand staff, assign any note higher than middle C (C4, MIDI 60) to the treble clef (right hand).

2. Assign any note lower than middle C (C4, MIDI 60) to the bass clef (left hand).

3. Middle C (C4) may be assigned to either clef, but by default assign it to treble clef for consistency unless context specifies otherwise (e.g., voicing or explicit hand crossing).

4. When importing or generating MusicXML for Sibelius, ensure all notes are explicitly tagged for their correct staff and clef according to these rules, to avoid incorrect note placement.
