## Phrase Categories

### 1. Melodic Cells (Flugelhorn, Flute, Violin I)
- 4–8 bar phrases in C Lydian, D Mixolydian, A Dorian.
- Use hexatonic subsets: C D E G A B.
- Behaviour:
  - Emphasise chord tones on strong beats.
  - Use enclosures around E, G, A as targets.
  - Range: a minor 10th, mostly stepwise with occasional 4th/5th leaps.

### 2. Inner Counterlines (Clarinet, Viola)
- 2–4 bar motifs, repeating with variation.
- Mostly stepwise, ornamenting 3rds, 6ths against melody.
- Dynamic contour: mf → p, subtle rather than foreground.

### 3. String Ostinati (Violin II, Viola, Cello)
- 1–2 bar patterns, eighth-note and sixteenth-note figures.
- Use triad pairs and quartal harmony for colour.
- Patterns for:
  - Section A: gentle, slow-moving.
  - Section C: more active, syncopated.

### 4. Guitar & Piano Rhythmic Engines
- Guitar: comping patterns, 2–4 bar loops, with syncopation, off-beat accents.
- Piano: left-hand low-register pulses, right-hand broken chords.
- Both should support and not clash with string ostinati.

### 5. Bass Foundations
