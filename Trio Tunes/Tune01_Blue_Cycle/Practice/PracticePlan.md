## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "My bends sound weak"
→ Use ring finger supported by middle finger
→ Push toward floor, not sideways
→ Practice matching pitch to fretted note

### "I can't hear the changes"
→ Sing root movement while playing
→ Practice guide tones (3rds and 7ths) only
→ Use drone backing track at first

### "The counterpoint is too hard"
→ Slow down to 50% tempo
→ Practice each voice separately for a week
→ Start with just bars 1-4

### "My improvisation sounds like an exercise"
→ Add more space (R-6)
→ Focus on one phrase per chorus
→ Listen more, play less
