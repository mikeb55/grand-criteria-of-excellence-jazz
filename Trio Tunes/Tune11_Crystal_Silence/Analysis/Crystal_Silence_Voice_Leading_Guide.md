## Open String Pedal Points

### A Pedal (bars 1-8)
The open A string can sustain through most of Section A:
```
Amaj9: A is root ✓
F#m11: A is 3rd ✓
Dmaj9: A is 5th ✓
E/A: A is pedal bass ✓
C#m7: A is b6 (avoid or use as color)
Bm9: A is b7 ✓
Esus4: A is 11 ✓
```

### E Pedal (all bars)
Open E works almost everywhere:
```
Amaj9: E is 5th ✓
F#m11: E is b7 ✓
Dmaj9: E is 9 ✓
E/A: E is root ✓
Fmaj7: E is 7th ✓
Gmaj7: E is 6th ✓
Bm9: E is 11 ✓
```

## Campanella Voice Leading

### Principle: Adjacent notes on different strings

**Example over bars 1-4:**
```
String:  1    2    1    3    2    4    1    2
Note:    E    B    E    A    C#   D    G#   B
Fret:    0    0    0    2    2    0    4    0
```
All notes ring together creating harp-like texture.

## Smooth Voice Leading Paths

### Upper Register Path (melody)
```
C#5 → A4 → F#4 → E4 → C#5 → E5 → D5 → G#4
  ↘    ↘    ↘    ↗    ↗    ↘    ↘
```

### Drone + Melody Separation
Keep voices in distinct registers:
- **Drone:** A2-E3 range (open strings)
- **Melody:** A4-E6 range (upper positions)

## Voicing Suggestions

### Open Position Voicings
```
Amaj9:   x-0-6-6-0-0
F#m11:   x-0-4-6-0-0
Dmaj9:   x-5-4-6-5-0
E/A:     x-0-2-1-0-0
Bm11:    x-2-4-2-0-0
```

### High Position + Open String
```
Amaj9:   x-12-11-13-12-0  (open high E)
Dmaj7:   x-x-11-11-10-0   (open high E)
```

## The "Crystal" Effect

To achieve the crystalline, bell-like sound:
1. Use different strings for adjacent notes
2. Let all notes ring (no dampening)
3. Use dynamics to shape, not articulation
4. Embrace the reverb tail as part of the music
