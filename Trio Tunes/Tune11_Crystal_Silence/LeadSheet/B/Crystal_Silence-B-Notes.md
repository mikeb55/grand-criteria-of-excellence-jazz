# Crystal Silence (B) - Campanella Arpeggios

## Intent
Harp-like arpeggiated lines where notes ring into each other.

## Campanella / Drone Technique
Campanella: Use different strings for adjacent notes so they overlap and sustain together.

## What to Listen For
1. The shimmering quality as notes sustain into each other
2. How register changes create variety
3. The difference between ascending and descending patterns

## Practice Focus
Play slowly and listen for overlapping sustain. Speed is not the goal.

## Version Comparison
| Version | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| A - Lyrical Sustain | The tune itself | Long tones, breathing phrases |
| B - Campanella Arpeggios | Harp-like resonance | Notes ring into each other |
| C - High Position + Drone | Sitar texture | Melody floats over pedal |
| D - Hybrid | Integration model | Combines all textures |
