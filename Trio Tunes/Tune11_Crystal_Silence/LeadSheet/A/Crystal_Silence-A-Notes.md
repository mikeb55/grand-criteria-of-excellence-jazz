# Crystal Silence (A) - Lyrical Sustain

## Intent
The tune itself. Long breathing phrases with maximum sustain. Whole and half notes predominate.

## Campanella / Drone Technique
Standard sustained playing with open strings ringing freely.

## What to Listen For
1. The arc of the phrase across 4-bar groups
2. How silence contributes to the music
3. The color shift at bars 9-10 (Fmaj7, Gmaj7)

## Practice Focus
Focus on letting every note ring its full duration. No dampening.

## Version Comparison
| Version | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| A - Lyrical Sustain | The tune itself | Long tones, breathing phrases |
| B - Campanella Arpeggios | Harp-like resonance | Notes ring into each other |
| C - High Position + Drone | Sitar texture | Melody floats over pedal |
| D - Hybrid | Integration model | Combines all textures |
