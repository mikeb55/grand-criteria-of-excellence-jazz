# Crystal Silence (C) - High Position + Drone

## Intent
Sitar-like texture with low drone and high melody.

## Campanella / Drone Technique
The open A or E string provides a continuous drone while melody floats in the high register.

## What to Listen For
1. The hypnotic quality of the continuous drone
2. How the high melody creates tension against the drone
3. The meditative, trance-like effect

## Practice Focus
Keep the drone ringing throughout. The melody should never overpower it.

## Version Comparison
| Version | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| A - Lyrical Sustain | The tune itself | Long tones, breathing phrases |
| B - Campanella Arpeggios | Harp-like resonance | Notes ring into each other |
| C - High Position + Drone | Sitar texture | Melody floats over pedal |
| D - Hybrid | Integration model | Combines all textures |
