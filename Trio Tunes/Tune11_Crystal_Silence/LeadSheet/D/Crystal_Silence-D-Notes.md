# Crystal Silence (D) - Hybrid

## Intent
Integration model combining lyrical, campanella, and drone textures.

## Campanella / Drone Technique
Seamlessly transitions between all three textures within the 16-bar form.

## What to Listen For
1. How the texture shifts at bars 5, 9, and 13
2. The unannounced transitions between styles
3. How each section complements the others

## Practice Focus
Practice each 4-bar section separately, then connect them smoothly.

## Version Comparison
| Version | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| A - Lyrical Sustain | The tune itself | Long tones, breathing phrases |
| B - Campanella Arpeggios | Harp-like resonance | Notes ring into each other |
| C - High Position + Drone | Sitar texture | Melody floats over pedal |
| D - Hybrid | Integration model | Combines all textures |
