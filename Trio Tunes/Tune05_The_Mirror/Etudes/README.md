## 📘 Included Etudes (PDF + MusicXML)

### 1. Quartal Chord-Melody Etude
Explores stacked 4ths, hybrid quartal shapes, and reflective inversion in A'.

**Harmonic Strategy:** Quartal stacks (4ths) in A section, quintal (5ths) inversion in A' for mirror effect.

### 2. Upper-Structure Triad Chord-Melody Etude
Triadic upper structures chosen according to melody-driven harmony rules and the Tonality Vault.

**Harmonic Strategy:** Upper triads selected based on melody note position (3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, #11, 13). A' uses mirrored triad choices (II instead of V).

### 3. Polychord Mirror Chord-Melody Etude ⭐ (Flagship)
Bi-triadic polychords derived from the melody. A' mirrors harmonic relationships for expressive contrast.

**Harmonic Strategy:** 
- A section: Upper triad over bass (e.g., Eb/Ab, Ab/F, G°/Db)
- Bridge: Distant polychords (D#/B, B/E, A/Eb tritone tension)
- A' Mirror: Inverted relationships (Ab/Eb instead of Eb/Ab)

### 4. Triad-Pair Solo Etude
A coherent modern jazz solo built from stable + tension triads, motivic cells, and density shaping.

**Harmonic Strategy:**
- Abmaj9: Stable = Ab, Tension = Eb
- Fm9: Stable = Ab, Tension = Eb (relative major pair)
- Dbmaj7#11: Stable = Db, Tension = G dim (#11 color)
- Eb7alt: Stable = Db, Tension = A (tritone pair)

### 5. Modern Comping Etude
A contemporary comping vocabulary study with stepwise inner voice-leading and rhythmic character.

**Features:**
- Dotted quarter + eighth rhythmic motif
- Stepwise inner voice motion (G→Ab, etc.)
- Modern extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)
- Dynamic shaping across the form

### 6. Counterpoint Etude
Melody + contrary-motion inner voice following contemporary counterpoint rules adapted for jazz guitar.

**Features:**
- Top voice: Melody (sustained notes)
- Bottom voice: Contrary motion (when top ascends, bottom descends)
- Voice crossing in bridge (Bar 9)
- Bar 15: Chromatic contrary motion (C→Cb top, Ab→A bottom)
- Bar 16: Voices converge on unison Eb, then spread to octave Ab

### 7. Variation Study (MAMS-based)
Three variations on the tune: melodic, rhythmic displacement, and density transformation.

**Variations:**
1. **Melodic Variation:** Embellished melody with approach notes and ornaments
2. **Rhythmic Displacement:** Accents shifted to weak beats, syncopation
3. **Density Variation:** Simple (single note) → Complex (full chords) → Simple (single note)
