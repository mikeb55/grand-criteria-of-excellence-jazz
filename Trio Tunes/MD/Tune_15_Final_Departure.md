## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Primary Universe (DbMaj9):** Db Lydian for maximum brightness.
*   **Minor Extensions (Bbm9, Fm9, Ebm9):** Dorian with 9ths for warmth.
*   **Lydian IV (GbMaj7#11):** Gb Lydian (#4 = C) — the signature ballad color.
*   **Suspended V (Ab7sus4):** Ab Mixolydian with sus4 — resolves to Ab7.

**Ballad Logic:**
*   Every chord has at least a 9th — creates the "orchestral" sound.
*   Drop-2 voicings spread across the neck for harp-like effect.
*   Rubato encouraged — stretch time on long notes.
*   This is the closing tune — let it breathe and resolve.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **DbMaj9** | **Db Major** | **Eb Major** | Lydian pair for brightness. |
| **Bbm9** | **Bb Minor** | **Db Major** | Relative major adds warmth. |
| **GbMaj7#11** | **Gb Major** | **Ab Major** | IV Lydian color. |
| **Ab7sus4** | **Ab Major** | **Db Major** | Sus4 pair resolves within. |
| **Fm9** | **F Minor** | **Ab Major** | Relative major for iii. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Descending whole step (F-Eb) with 9th suspension (Eb-F) — the ballad sigh.

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus A: Lyrical Melody (Orchestral)**
*   **Concept:** Long, sustained melody with orchestral sweep.
*   **Motif:** Descending 3rd followed by ascending 2nd (F-Db-Eb).
*   **Bars 1-4:** Establish the sweeping theme over I-vi-IV-V.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Melody rises through iii-vi-ii; peak on bar 8.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Sus4 tension resolves; melody descends.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Final phrase; 13th chord provides closure.

### **Chorus B: Modern Triad-Pair Lines**
*   **Concept:** Arpeggiated triads that sustain and overlap.
*   **Bar 1-2 (DbMaj9-Bbm11):** Db/Eb pair ascending, Bb/Db descending.
*   **Bar 3-4 (GbMaj7#11-AbMaj7):** Gb/Ab Lydian cascade.
*   **Bar 15-16:** Final Db/Eb pair settles on the 13th.
*   **Goal:** Harp-like arpeggios at ballad tempo.

### **Chorus C: Wyble Two-Voice Counterpoint**
*   **Concept:** Sustained bass notes against moving melody.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Bottom Voice:* Whole-note bass roots (Db-Bb-Gb-Ab...).
    *   *Top Voice:* Half and quarter-note melody, independent motion.
*   **Key Moment (Bar 9 - Ab7sus4):** Bass holds Ab; melody resolves sus4 to 3rd.
*   **Ending:** Both voices expand from unison Db to octave Db + F (3rd).

### **Chorus D: Hybrid Synthesis**
*   **Concept:** Combines orchestral melody, arpeggiated triads, and sustained bass.
*   **Bars 1-4:** Lyrical melody (Chorus A) over sustained bass.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Arpeggiated triad motion (Chorus B) builds warmth.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Counterpoint (Chorus C) through sus4 resolution.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Return to sustained melody; final chord spreads to 13th.
*   **Dynamic Arc:** pp → p → mp → pp (intimate throughout).

## 5. GUITAR VOICING SET (Drop-2 Orchestral)

*   **DbMaj9:** `x-4-3-5-4-4` (Drop-2 with 9th on top).

---

## 6. RUBATO AND EXPRESSION GUIDE

*   **Rubato:** Stretch time on long notes; compress on passing tones.
*   **Dynamics:** Start pp; never exceed mp — intimacy is key.
*   **Vibrato:** Wide, slow vibrato on sustained notes.
*   **Breathing:** Imagine singing the line; pause where you would breathe.
*   **Final Chord:** Let it ring for 4-8 beats; use volume swell into silence.

## 8. ALBUM CLOSING NOTES

"Final Departure" is designed to be the closing track of the Trio Tunes album. Its peaceful resolution and orchestral warmth provide closure to the diverse stylistic journey of the preceding 14 tunes. The final Db Major 13th chord, with its added 13th (Bb), creates a sense of openness and possibility — an invitation to return to the beginning of the album or to carry the music forward into the listener's imagination.

**Play this tune last. Let it breathe. Let it go.**
