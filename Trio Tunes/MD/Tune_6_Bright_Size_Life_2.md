## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Primary Universe (DMaj7/D Pedal):** D Lydian for brightness (#4 = G#), or D Ionian for warmth.
*   **Modal Float (Em7/D, F#m7/D):** Treat as color over the D pedal — E Dorian, F# Phrygian.
*   **Suspended Resolution (A7sus4):** A Mixolydian with suspended 4th — never fully resolve.
*   **Connective Tissue:** D Major Pentatonic unifies all sections.

**Metheny Logic:**
*   The D pedal point sustains through bars 1-8 — let it ring as the chords float above.
*   Bars 9-14 release the pedal for momentary movement, then return.
*   Keep the articulation legato and floating — avoid hard attacks.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **DMaj7** | **D Major** | **E Major** | Lydian pair — D/E creates the "bright" shimmer. |
| **Em7/D** | **E Minor** | **G Major** | Relative major provides lift. |
| **GMaj7** | **G Major** | **A Major** | Lydian approach to IV. |
| **Bm7** | **B Minor** | **D Major** | Relative major pair for vi chord. |
| **A7sus4** | **A Major** | **D Major** | Sus4 resolves within the triad pair. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Continuous 8th-note arpeggios cycling through D/E triads.

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus A: Lyrical Melody (Flowing)**
*   **Concept:** Long, singing lines that float over the D pedal.
*   **Motif:** Ascending 3rd (D-F#) followed by descending step (F#-E-D).
*   **Bars 1-4:** Establish floating theme with half notes resolving to quarter-note motion.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Same melodic shape transposed through IV-iii-ii.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Release from pedal — melody becomes more active, ascending.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Return to opening shape with added upper octave.

### **Chorus B: Modern Triad-Pair Lines**
*   **Concept:** Continuous 8th-note triad arpeggios in constant motion.
*   **Bar 1-2 (DMaj7):** D triad ascending, E triad descending — classic Metheny Lydian cascade.
*   **Bar 5-6 (GMaj7/D → F#m7/D):** G triad to A triad, then invert to F#m.
*   **Bar 9-10 (Bm7 → A7sus4):** Bm to D triad, A to D triad — sus4 resolution.
*   **Bar 15-16:** D/E pair returns, ends on sustained A (5th).
*   **Goal:** Flowing, pianistic lines with no accents — like a brook.

### **Chorus C: Wyble Two-Voice Counterpoint**
*   **Concept:** Sustained D pedal point in bass against floating melody.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Bottom Voice:* Open D string or low D octave, whole notes or half notes.
    *   *Top Voice:* Flowing quarter and 8th-note melody, independent of bass.
*   **Key Moment (Bar 5 - GMaj7/D):** Bass holds D; melody walks G-A-B-C# (Lydian ascent).
*   **Key Moment (Bar 9-12):** Bass finally moves (Bm-A-G-F#); melody descends in contrary motion.
*   **Ending:** Both voices arrive on unison D, expand to D-A-F# chord.

### **Chorus D: Hybrid Synthesis**
*   **Concept:** Combines flowing lyrical lines with triad-pair motion and pedal point.
*   **Bars 1-4:** Lyrical melody (Chorus A) over D pedal bass (Chorus C).
*   **Bars 5-8:** Triad-pair runs (Chorus B) with bass pedal continuing.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Full two-voice counterpoint as bass releases.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Return to lyrical, bass resumes pedal, final chord expansion.
*   **Dynamic Arc:** pp (1-4) → p (5-8) → mf (9-12) → p (13-16) — intimate throughout.

## 5. GUITAR VOICING SET (Open Voicings)

*   **DMaj7:** `x-x-0-2-2-2` (D pedal with close voicing above).
*   **Em7/D:** `x-x-0-0-0-0` (All open strings — Metheny effect).
*   **GMaj7/D:** `x-x-0-4-3-2` (D bass, G triad above).
*   **F#m7/D:** `x-x-0-2-2-2` (D bass, F#m upper structure).
*   **A7sus4:** `x-0-2-0-3-0` (Open A with sus4).
*   **DMaj9:** `x-x-0-2-2-0` (Open high E adds 9th).

## 6. PEDAL POINT TECHNIQUE GUIDE

*   **Bass Pedal:** Let the low D ring throughout bars 1-8; damp slightly on beat 4 if needed.
*   **Chord Motion:** Keep upper voices legato; use hammer-ons and pull-offs.
*   **Right Hand:** Light touch, near the neck pickup for warmth.
*   **Dynamics:** Stay soft — the beauty is in the sustain and blending.
