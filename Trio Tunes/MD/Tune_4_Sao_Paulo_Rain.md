## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Primary Universe (Dm9):** D Aeolian / D Melodic Minor (for movement).
*   **Secondary Universe (Bbmaj7):** Bb Lydian.
*   **Altered Dominant (A7alt):** A Super Locrian.
*   **Targeting:** Aiming for the 9ths and 11ths of the minor chords.

**Barry Harris Logic:**
*   On **Dm9**, use **D Minor 6 Diminished** scale.
*   This creates movement between the static minor chord tones.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Dm9** | **D Minor** | **C Major** | Defines the Dorian/Aeolian 9th sound (C-E-G over Dm). |
| **Bbmaj7** | **Bb Major** | **C Major** | Lydian sound (C Major triad gives 9-#11-6). |
| **A7alt** | **Eb Major** | **F Major** | Tritone sub pairs (Eb/A = b5/b9; F/A = #5/R). |
| **Gm9** | **G Minor** | **F Major** | Dorian 9th sound again. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Arpeggiate the *Color Triad* up and the *Stable Triad* down.

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus 1: Lyrical Melody (Jobim Style)**
*   **Concept:** Motivic simplicity.
*   **Motif:** F - E - D (3-2-1) descending line.
*   **Rhythm:** Anticipated downbeats (The "and" of 4).

### **Chorus 2: Modern Triad-Pair Lines**
*   **Concept:** 8th note lines weaving between the pairs.
*   **Focus:** Smooth voice leading between the C Major triad (over Dm) and the C Major triad (over Bbmaj7).

### **Chorus 3: Wyble Two-Voice Counterpoint**
*   **Concept:** Bossa Bass + Melody.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Bottom Voice:* Root-5th Bossa pattern (dotted quarter - eighth).
    *   *Top Voice:* Syncopated melody independent of the bass rhythm.
*   **Challenge:** Physical separation of thumb and fingers.

## 5. OPTIONAL GUITAR VOICING SET (Bossa Grips)

*   **Bbmaj7:** `6-x-7-7-6-x` (Shell + Extensions).
