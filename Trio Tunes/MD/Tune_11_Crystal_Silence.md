## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Primary Universe (AMaj9):** A Lydian (with #4 = D#) for ethereal color.
*   **Minor Pools (F#m, Bm, C#m):** Natural minor with major 9th for ECM warmth.
*   **Lydian IV (DMaj7#11):** D Lydian (#4 = G#) — the signature ECM sound.
*   **Suspended V (Esus4):** E Mixolydian with suspended 4th — never fully resolves.

**ECM Logic:**
*   Use open strings (E, A, D, G, B, high E) as sustained pedals.
*   High position voicings (frets 7-12) with open strings create the "harp" effect.
*   Let notes ring into each other — avoid damping.
*   Rubato is encouraged; breathe with the phrases.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **AMaj9** | **A Major** | **B Major** | 9th adds the "floating" quality. |
| **DMaj7#11** | **D Major** | **E Major** | Lydian pair for IV. |
| **F#m9** | **F# Minor** | **A Major** | Relative major adds warmth. |
| **Esus4** | **E Major** | **A Major** | Sus4 resolves within pair. |
| **Bm9** | **B Minor** | **D Major** | Relative major for ii chord. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Descending 9th interval (B to A an octave below) — the "bell" sound.

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus A: Lyrical Melody (Campanella)**
*   **Concept:** Sustained, singing melody with open string resonance.
*   **Motif:** Long whole notes and dotted-halves that ring together.
*   **Bars 1-4:** Establish the floating theme; let open E and B strings ring.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Descending melody over ascending bass inversions.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Slight build with half-note motion; still legato.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Return to opening; final chord adds 13th for color.

### **Chorus B: Modern Triad-Pair Lines**
*   **Concept:** Arpeggiated triads that sustain into each other.
*   **Bar 1-2 (AMaj9-F#m11):** A/B pair ascending, F#m/A descending — sustained.
*   **Bar 3-4 (DMaj7#11-Bm9):** D/E Lydian pair, B/D minor pair.
*   **Bar 9-12:** Build with slightly faster 8ths, still legato.
*   **Goal:** Harp-like arpeggios that blur together.

### **Chorus C: Wyble Two-Voice Counterpoint**
*   **Concept:** Open string bass pedals against high-position melody.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Bottom Voice:* Open A and E strings as sustained pedals.
    *   *Top Voice:* High-position melody (frets 9-14) on strings 1-3.
*   **Key Moment (Bar 3 - DMaj7#11):** Open A pedal; melody plays high G# (fret 16 or 14+2).
*   **Key Moment (Bar 12 - Esus4):** Open E bass; melody sustains high A.
*   **Ending:** Open strings A and E ring together under high C#.

### **Chorus D: Hybrid Synthesis**
*   **Concept:** Combines sustained melody, arpeggiated triads, and open-string pedals.
*   **Bars 1-4:** Campanella melody (Chorus A) with open string bass.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Arpeggiated triad pairs (Chorus B) over sustained pedals.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Two-voice texture (Chorus C) with slight crescendo.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Return to sustained melody; final chord spreads across all strings.
*   **Dynamic Arc:** pp throughout — intimacy is key.

## 5. GUITAR VOICING SET (Open String Voicings)

*   **AMaj9:** `x-0-6-6-0-0` (Open A, high A/B/E ringing).
*   **F#m11:** `x-x-4-6-0-0` (Open B/E against F#m).
*   **DMaj7#11:** `x-x-0-6-7-0` (Open D and high E, G# on string 2).
*   **Bm9:** `x-2-4-2-0-0` (Open B/E, Bm voicing).
*   **Esus4:** `0-2-2-2-0-0` (Open E and all open strings).
*   **AMaj9(add13):** `x-0-7-6-7-0` (F# on top as 13th).

## 6. CAMPANELLA TECHNIQUE GUIDE

*   **Definition:** Notes played on adjacent strings ring into each other.
*   **Execution:** Use hybrid picking (pick + fingers) to sustain multiple strings.
*   **Open Strings:** E-A-D-G-B-E are your sustained pedal points.
*   **High Position:** Frets 7-14 on strings 1-3 provide the "chime" melody.
*   **Damping:** Avoid it — let everything ring.
