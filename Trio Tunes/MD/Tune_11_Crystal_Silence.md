## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Primary Universe (AMaj9):** A Ionian / A Lydian.
*   **Relative Minor (F#m11):** F# Dorian / F# Aeolian.
*   **Borrowed bVI (FMaj7#11):** F Lydian.
*   **Borrowed bIII (CMaj7#11):** C Lydian.
*   **Chromatic (DbMaj7, Eb7#11):** Respective Lydian/Lydian Dominant scales.

**ECM Logic:**
*   **Space and sustain** — notes should ring and overlap.
*   **Campanella technique** — use open strings while playing fretted notes higher up.
*   **Lydian preference** — the #11 adds "air" to the voicings.
*   **Avoid "jazzy" chromaticism** — aim for pure, bell-like tones.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **AMaj9** | **A Major** | **B Minor** | Creates Maj9 sound. |
| **F#m11** | **F# Minor** | **A Major** | Dorian relative pair. |
| **DMaj7#11** | **D Major** | **E Major** | Lydian pair. |
| **FMaj7#11** | **F Major** | **G Major** | Borrowed Lydian. |
| **CMaj7#11** | **C Major** | **D Major** | Borrowed Lydian. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Arpeggiate Color Triad from high E string with open B and E ringing.

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus 1: Campanella Melody**
*   **Concept:** Use open strings as drones while melody moves on adjacent strings.
*   **Motif:** High G# (1st string, 16th fret) with open E ringing.
*   **Bars 1-4:** Melody on string 1, open strings 2 and 1 ring sympathetically.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Add open A (5th string) as bass pedal.
*   **Bars 9-16 (B):** Shift position; let new open strings ring.

### **Chorus 2: High Position Open String Study**
*   **Concept:** Exploit E-B-G-D open strings while playing above the 12th fret.
*   **Bar 1 (AMaj9):** E at 12th fret (1st string) + open E (1st string harmonic) → unison.
*   **Bar 9 (FMaj7#11):** High A (17th fret, 1st string) + open B (2nd string) ringing.
*   **Goal:** Create the "glass-like" ECM texture.

### **Chorus 3: Sustain & Overlap Study**
*   **Concept:** Each note should ring into the next; no staccato.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Bars 1-8:* Play slowly; wait for previous note to decay 50%.
    *   *Bars 9-16:* Slightly closer attacks; notes overlap more.
    *   *Bars 25-32:* Maximum overlap; near-constant wash of sound.
*   **Key Moment (Bar 32 — Decay):** Final AMaj9 rings until complete silence.

*   **FMaj7#11:** `1-x-2-2-1-0` (Open E on top).
