## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Primary Universe (E9):** E Mixolydian / E Blues Scale hybrid.
*   **Subdominant (A13):** A Mixolydian with added 6th/13th.
*   **Borrowed (G9):** G Mixolydian — from E minor parallel.
*   **Blues Dominant (E7#9, F#7#9):** E Blues / E Minor Pentatonic over dom7#9.
*   **Altered (C#7alt):** C# Altered Scale / D Melodic Minor.

**Scofield Logic:**
*   **Mix major and minor 3rds freely** — the #9 sound is central.
*   Use **chromatic approach notes** aggressively.
*   **Open strings (E, B)** function as pedal drones throughout.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **E9** | **E Major** | **D Major** | Mixolydian pair (1-3-5 + b7-9-11). |
| **A13** | **A Major** | **F# Minor** | Creates the 13th sound. |
| **G9** | **G Major** | **F Major** | bIII Mixolydian color. |
| **B7#9** | **B Major** | **D Major** | Hendrix-chord tension (root vs b3). |
| **C#7alt** | **G Major** | **Db Major** | Tritone sub framework. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Pentatonic riff on Stable Triad → Chromatic slide into Color Triad root.

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus 1: Funky Riff-Based (Groove)**
*   **Concept:** Repetitive 2-bar riffs with rhythmic displacement.
*   **Motif:** Low E string pedal with hammered 3rds (G#-A, G-G#).
*   **Bars 1-4:** Establish the main groove — syncopated 16th notes.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Riff moves to A string, keeping E as drone.
*   **Bars 17-24 (B Section):** Break the riff — longer held notes for contrast.

### **Chorus 2: Angular Bebop Lines over Funk**
*   **Concept:** Apply bebop vocabulary over the funk changes — Scofield's signature.
*   **Bar 1 (E9):** E-G#-A-B-C#-D-E enclosure.
*   **Bar 6 (G9):** Bb-A-G-F-D (chromatic enclosure of G).
*   **Bar 20 (E7#9):** G-G#-B-D-E — major/minor ambiguity.
*   **Goal:** Continuous 8th-note lines with heavy chromaticism.

### **Chorus 3: Open String Drone Study**
*   **Concept:** Exploit open E and B strings as constant pedals.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Bars 1-8:* Melody on strings 1-3 with open E (6th string) sounding.
    *   *Bars 9-16:* Add open B (2nd string) drone; melody on 1st string.
    *   *Bars 17-24:* Harmonics at 12th fret layered with fretted notes.
*   **Key Moment (Bar 8 — B7#9):** Hammer the open E while playing D on 3rd fret, G# on 1st fret.

## 5. OPTIONAL GUITAR VOICING SET (Gritty & Open)

*   **E9:** `0-7-6-7-5-0` (Open E voicing with 9th).
*   **A13:** `x-0-6-6-7-5` (Open A string bass).
*   **G9:** `3-x-3-4-3-x` (Compact cluster).
*   **B7#9:** `x-2-1-2-3-x` (Hendrix voicing).
*   **E7#9:** `0-7-6-7-8-0` (Open position funk chord).
