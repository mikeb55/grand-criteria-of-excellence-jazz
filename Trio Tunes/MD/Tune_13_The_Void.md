## 1. COMPACT LEAD SHEET (Form: Through-Composed Graphic Score)

*   **Section A:** "Points." Single staccato notes with wide separation. Silence > Sound.
*   **Section B:** "Clouds." Volume swells using delay/reverb. Pitch sets: Whole Tone & Diminished.
*   **Section C:** "Chaos." Rapid, non-metered runs. Atonal chromaticism.

## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Pitch Set 1:** Chromatic Hexachord (C-C#-D-Eb-E-F).
*   **Pitch Set 2:** Octatonic (Diminished).
*   **Pitch Set 3:** Random 12-tone row.

**Barry Harris Logic:**
*   Even in free jazz, gravity exists. Use **Tritone substitution** logic to create tension/release without functional chords.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Free** | **C Major** | **F# Major** | Petrushka Chord / Bitonal clash. |
| **Free** | **D Minor** | **Eb Minor** | Semitone clash. |
| **Free** | **G Augmented** | **A Augmented** | Whole tone clash. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Superimposing two unrelated triads to create maximum dissonance.

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus 1: Lyrical Melody (Timbral)**
*   **Concept:** Melody is tone color.
*   **Technique:** Pick scraping, behind-the-bridge plucking, harmonics.
*   **Goal:** Make the guitar sound unlike a guitar.

### **Chorus 2: Modern Triad-Pair Lines**
*   **Concept:** Intervallics.
*   **Pattern:** Perfect 4ths vs. Tritones.
*   **Rhythm:** Accelerando / Ritardando (Time is elastic).

### **Chorus 3: Wyble Two-Voice Counterpoint**
*   **Concept:** Independent Polytonality.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Bottom Voice:* Low E string drone.
    *   *Top Voice:* Moving chromatic clusters.
*   **Effect:** Tension against a static root.

## 5. OPTIONAL GUITAR VOICING SET (Cluster Chords)
