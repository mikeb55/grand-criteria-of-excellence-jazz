## 1. STRUCTURAL GUIDE (Form: Through-Composed Sections)

> **Note:** This piece has no fixed harmony. The "lead sheet" is a roadmap of textures and techniques.

| Section | Duration | Texture | Technique Focus | Dynamic |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **I** | ~2 min | Sparse, pointillistic | Harmonics (natural/artificial) | ppp → pp |
| **II** | ~1.5 min | Building clusters | Behind-the-nut bends, prepared guitar | pp → mp |
| **III** | ~2 min | Dense, aggressive | Feedback, distortion, tremolo picking | mp → ff |
| **IV** | ~1.5 min | Deconstruction | Extended techniques breakdown | ff → mf |
| **V** | ~2 min | Return to sparse | Harmonics, volume swells | mf → ppp |

## 2. TIMBRAL PALETTE STUDY

*   **Harmonics:**
    *   **Natural:** 12th, 7th, 5th fret nodes.
    *   **Artificial:** Pick + thumb touch at octave above fretted note.
    *   **Harp harmonics:** Touch harmonic node, pluck with another finger.
*   **Extended Techniques:**
    *   **Behind-the-nut:** Press strings behind nut for microtonal bends.
    *   **Prepared guitar:** Paper clips, felt, e-bow between strings.
    *   **Bow:** Violin/cello bow on wound strings.
*   **Feedback:**
    *   Position relative to amp for controlled sustain.
    *   Use volume knob to swell in/out of feedback.

**Free Improvisation Logic:**
*   **Sound IS the composition** — pitch is secondary to texture.
*   **Dynamics create form** — the arc from silence to noise to silence.
*   **Listen more than play** — react to the decay, the room, the resonance.

## 3. TEXTURAL MAP (Conceptual Triad-Pairs)

| Section | "Stable" Sound | "Tension" Sound | Emotional Function |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **I** | Natural harmonics | Artificial harmonics | Mystery, questioning |
| **II** | Clusters (clean) | Clusters (distorted) | Building unease |
| **III** | Distorted power | White noise/feedback | Crisis, chaos |
| **IV** | Fragmented melody | Silence/space | Collapse |
| **V** | Pure harmonics | Resonant decay | Resolution, void |

**Conceptual Cell:** Contrast between "pure" (harmonics) and "impure" (noise) timbres.

## 4. THREE IMPROVISATION FRAMEWORKS

### **Framework 1: Harmonic Cathedral**
*   **Concept:** Build vertical "towers" of stacked harmonics.
*   **Section I:** Single harmonic notes, widely spaced.
*   **Section III:** Layer multiple harmonics simultaneously (requires sustain/delay).
*   **Section V:** Return to single harmonic; let it decay for 30+ seconds.

### **Framework 2: Textural Gradient**
*   **Concept:** Continuous transformation from one timbre to another.
*   **Process:**
    1. Start with clean, fingerpicked note.
    2. Gradually add gain.
    3. Increase gain until feedback emerges.
    4. Control feedback with volume knob.
    5. Reduce gain; return to clean.
*   **Goal:** No sudden changes; all transitions are gradual.

### **Framework 3: Call and Silence**
*   **Concept:** Each sound is followed by silence of equal or greater length.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Section I:* One note; 10 seconds of silence.
    *   *Section III:* Short burst; 5 seconds of silence.
    *   *Section V:* Final harmonic; infinite silence.
*   **Key Principle:** Silence is the "answer" to every "question."

## 5. EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

*   **Guitar:** Any electric; hollow-body adds resonance.
*   **Amplifier:** Tube amp preferred for natural breakup.
*   **Effects (Optional):**
    *   **Volume pedal:** Essential for swells.
    *   **Reverb:** Long decay (hall or shimmer).
    *   **Delay:** For layering harmonics.
    *   **Fuzz/Distortion:** For Section III aggression.
    *   **E-Bow:** For infinite sustain passages.
*   **Accessories:**
    *   Violin bow
    *   Alligator clips
    *   Paper clips, felt, foam for preparation

## 6. FINAL EVALUATION

1.  **Clarity:** (3/5) Free form requires active listener engagement.
2.  **MDH:** (N/A) No fixed melody or harmony.
3.  **Voice-Leading:** (N/A) Traditional voice-leading not applicable.
4.  **Counterpoint:** (4/5) Texture vs. silence creates implied counterpoint.
5.  **Triad Colour:** (N/A) Replaced by timbral contrast.
6.  **Playability:** (5/5) No fixed pitches; focus on physical techniques.
7.  **Structure:** (5/5) Clear 5-section arc provides roadmap.
8.  **Emotional Arc:** Void → Emergence → Crisis → Dissolution → Void.
9.  **Originality:** (5/5) Fully experimental; no jazz conventions.
10. **Unifying Tech:** (5/5) Harmonics and dynamic arc unify the piece.

**Status:** **APPROVED.** Ready for performance.
