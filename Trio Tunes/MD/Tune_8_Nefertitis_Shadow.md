## 2. SCALE PALETTE STUDY

*   **Primary Universe (EbMaj7):** Eb Lydian or Eb Ionian — bright, open.
*   **Minor Pools (Cm9, Fm11, Gm9):** Dorian mode for each — keeps the brightness.
*   **Borrowed Colors (DbMaj7, GbMaj7):** Lydian for both — the Shorter "cloud."
*   **Single Dominant (D7alt):** D Altered Scale — the only true V7 in the piece.

**Shorter Logic:**
*   The melody note is the composition — harmonize downward from it.
*   BbmMaj7 (bar 7) is the "Shorter moment" — minor chord with major 7th.
*   F7sus4 (bar 13) never resolves to Bb as a dominant — it's modal.
*   The augmented final chord (bar 16) creates the "unfinished" feeling.

## 3. TRIAD-PAIR / TRIAD-TENSION MAP

| Chord | Stable Triad | Color/Tension Triad | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **EbMaj7** | **Eb Major** | **F Major** | Lydian pair for brightness. |
| **AbMaj7#11** | **Ab Major** | **Bb Major** | IV Lydian color. |
| **DbMaj7** | **Db Major** | **Eb Major** | bVII to I connection. |
| **D7alt** | **Ab Major** | **Eb Minor** | Tritone substitution triads. |
| **BbmMaj7** | **Bb Minor** | **A Major** | Augmented pair for minor-major quality. |

**Melodic Cell Idea:** Descending 4th (G-D) answered by ascending minor 2nd (D-Eb).

## 4. THREE ETUDE CHORUSES

### **Chorus A: Lyrical Melody (Shorter-Style)**
*   **Concept:** Long, sustained melody notes that the harmony supports.
*   **Motif:** Held dotted-half notes on strong beats; quarter-note passing tones.
*   **Bars 1-4:** Establish the hovering theme over I-vi-IV-ii.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Color pool (bVII-bIII-vMaj7) — melody descends chromatically.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Tritone ii-V is the only functional moment — emphasize F#.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Return to I with augmented ending — melody lands on B natural.

### **Chorus B: Modern Triad-Pair Lines**
*   **Concept:** Continuous 8th notes using stacked triads.
*   **Bar 1-2 (EbMaj7-Cm9):** Eb/F pair ascending, then C minor/D major descending.
*   **Bar 5-6 (DbMaj7-GbMaj7):** Db/Eb pair to Gb/Ab pair — modal cascade.
*   **Bar 9-10 (Am7b5-D7alt):** A diminished to Ab/Eb minor — altered color.
*   **Bar 15-16:** Eb/F pair returns, ends on B natural (augmented 5th).
*   **Goal:** Fluid, horn-like lines at 180 BPM.

### **Chorus C: Wyble Two-Voice Counterpoint**
*   **Concept:** Sustained melody against moving inner voice.
*   **Texture:**
    *   *Top Voice:* Long, sustained melody (as written in bars).
    *   *Middle Voice:* Quarter-note guide tones moving chromatically.
*   **Key Moment (Bar 7 - BbmMaj7):** Top holds A (maj7); middle walks Bb-A-Ab-G.
*   **Key Moment (Bar 10 - D7alt):** Top holds F#; middle walks D-Eb-E-F.
*   **Ending:** Voices converge on G (3rd of Eb), then top moves to B (augmented).

### **Chorus D: Hybrid Synthesis**
*   **Concept:** Shorter-style sustained melody with triad-pair bursts and guide-tone motion.
*   **Bars 1-4:** Sustained melody (Chorus A) with guide-tone bass.
*   **Bars 5-8:** Triad-pair runs (Chorus B) over the color pool.
*   **Bars 9-12:** Full two-voice texture (Chorus C) through the tritone ii-V.
*   **Bars 13-16:** Return to sustained melody, ends on augmented chord.
*   **Dynamic Arc:** mp (1-4) → mf (5-8) → f (9-12) → mp (13-16).

## 5. GUITAR VOICING SET (Shorter Voicings)

*   **EbMaj7:** `x-6-8-7-8-x` (Eb with Lydian #11 available).
*   **Cm9:** `x-3-5-3-4-3` (Close voicing with 9th on top).
*   **AbMaj7#11:** `4-x-5-5-4-x` (Lydian voicing with D natural).
*   **BbmMaj7:** `x-1-3-2-2-1` (Minor-major with A natural on top).
*   **D7alt:** `x-5-4-5-5-x` (Altered voicing with #9/b13).
*   **EbMaj7(#5):** `x-6-5-8-8-x` (Augmented chord with B natural).

## 6. SHORTER PHRASING GUIDE

*   **Sustain:** Hold melody notes as long as possible; let the band comp underneath.
*   **Space:** Leave gaps between phrases for the rhythm section to breathe.
*   **Chromaticism:** Use half-step approaches into chord tones.
*   **Augmented Endings:** Don't resolve — let the #5 ring.
