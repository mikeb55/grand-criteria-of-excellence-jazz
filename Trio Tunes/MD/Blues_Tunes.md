### Barry Harris Logic:
- **G#dim7 (Bar 4)** connects G7 to Am7 (or C7) chromatically.

- Treat diminished chords as **passing dominants** (G#dim7 = E7b9, C#dim7 = A7b9).

### Key Features:

## Why Barry Harris Logic Works for Blues

Barry Harris's 6th Diminished Scale system treats diminished chords as:
1. **Chromatic connectors** between diatonic chords
2. **Passing dominants** (e.g., G#dim7 = E7b9 without the root)
3. **Harmonic bridges** that create smooth voice-leading

This approach adds modern harmonic color while maintaining the essential blues vocabulary.
