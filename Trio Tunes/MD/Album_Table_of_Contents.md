# ALBUM OVERVIEW: THE GCE JAZZ GUITAR COLLECTION

| Tune # | Title | Key | BPM | Time | Style | Uniqueness Tagline | Playing Tip |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | **"Blue Cycle"** | Bb | 120 | 4/4 | Blues (Cycle) | Wyble counterpoint meets Coltrane changes. | Focus on hand separation; keep bass independent. |
| **2** | **"Orbit"** | F | 160 | 3/4 | Wayne Shorter (Avant) | Non-functional harmony over a floating pulse. | Let the intervals ring; prioritize sustain. |
| **3** | **"Rust & Chrome"** | E | 95 | 4/4 | Scofield Funk | Gritty, angular lines with open string drones. | Dig in with the right hand; use legato slides. |
| **4** | **"Sao Paulo Rain"** | D | 130 | 4/4 | Bossa Nova | Melodic minor shapes over static pedal points. | Keep the rhythm steady; let the melody float. |
| **5** | **"The Mirror"** | Ab | 60 | 4/4 | Scofield Ballad | Sparse, haunting voicings with wide spreads. | Use volume swells; control the decay. |
| **6** | **"Bright Size Life 2"** | D | 145 | 4/4 | Pat Metheny | Triad pairs moving constantly over a pedal. | Play with a light, fluid touch; no accents. |
| **7** | **"Monk's Dream"** | C | 110 | 4/4 | Experimental | Whole-tone clusters and displaced rhythms. | Feel the space; don't rush the silence. |
| **8** | **"Nefertiti's Shadow"** | Eb | 180 | 4/4 | Wayne Shorter (Post-Bop) | Melody dictates harmony; no recurring V7s. | Listen to the top note; harmonization flows down. |
| **9** | **"Greezy"** | G | 100 | 12/8 | Blues (Shuffle) | Traditional shuffle with modern diminished subs. | Lock with the imaginary drummer's triplet feel. |
| **10** | **"Hexagon"** | B | 135 | 5/4 | Original (Odd Meter) | A 5/4 groove built on hexatonic scales. | Count "1-2-3, 1-2" internally until natural. |
| **11** | **"Crystal Silence"** | A | 80 | 4/4 | ECM Ballad | Open string voicings high up the neck. | Let strings ring into each other (campanella). |
| **12** | **"Angular Motion"** | Gb | 200 | 4/4 | Bebop/Etude | Wide interval skips at fast tempos. | Economy picking is essential here. |
| **13** | **"The Void"** | Free | Free | Free | Experimental | Textural improvisation guide; no fixed chords. | Focus on timbre and dynamic swells. |
| **14** | **"Solar Flare"** | C# | 150 | 7/8 | Fusion/Original | Rapid-fire triad pairs in a 7/8 ostinato. | Accent the first beat of the 3 and the 2 groups. |
| **15** | **"Final Departure"** | Db | 70 | 4/4 | Closing Ballad | Lush, orchestral drop-2 voicings. | Play rubato; breathe with the phrases. |
| **16** | **"Blue Minor"** | Cm | 110 | 4/4 | Minor Blues | Essential minor blues with melodic minor colors. | Let the minor 3rd ring; master the minor ii-V. |
