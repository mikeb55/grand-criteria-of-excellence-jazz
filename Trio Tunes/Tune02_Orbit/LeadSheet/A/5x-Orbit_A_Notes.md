# Orbit (A) – Lyrical

## Intent
The tune itself. Sparse, singing melody with long tones and ties across barlines. Emphasis on intervallic contour (6ths, 7ths, 9ths). Frequent space and silence. Should sound complete alone with just a metronome.

## What to Listen For
- How does this version create its own sense of forward motion?
- Where are the moments of tension and release?
- How does the melodic contour serve the overall aesthetic?

## How It Differs from Other Versions
| Version | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| A – Lyrical | The tune itself | Sparse, singing, space |
| B – Modern Triad Pairs | Tonality Vault | Continuous, architectural |
| C – Counterpoint | Linear independence | Two voices, contrary motion |
| D – Hybrid | Integration model | Combines all textures |

## Practice Suggestions
1. Play through slowly, focusing on tone and sustain
2. Analyze the intervallic content
3. Compare with other versions to understand textural contrasts
4. Use as a springboard for your own improvisations
