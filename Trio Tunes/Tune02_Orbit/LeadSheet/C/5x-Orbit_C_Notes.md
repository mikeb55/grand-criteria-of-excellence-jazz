# Orbit (C) – Counterpoint

## Intent
Linear independence. Two independent melodic voices on one guitar staff. Contrary or oblique motion preferred. Clear registral separation with no voice doubling. Horizontal logic dominates. Reads like linear composition, not 'changes.'

## What to Listen For
- How does this version create its own sense of forward motion?
- Where are the moments of tension and release?
- How does the melodic contour serve the overall aesthetic?

## How It Differs from Other Versions
| Version | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| A – Lyrical | The tune itself | Sparse, singing, space |
| B – Modern Triad Pairs | Tonality Vault | Continuous, architectural |
| C – Counterpoint | Linear independence | Two voices, contrary motion |
| D – Hybrid | Integration model | Combines all textures |

## Practice Suggestions
1. Play through slowly, focusing on tone and sustain
2. Analyze the intervallic content
3. Compare with other versions to understand textural contrasts
4. Use as a springboard for your own improvisations
