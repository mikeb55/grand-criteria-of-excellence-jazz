# Orbit (B) – Modern Triad Pairs

## Intent
Tonality Vault / modern linear motion. Continuous or near-continuous 8ths with strict triad-pair logic derived from the Lydian scale palette. Angular, non-scalar, non-bebop. Momentum without cadence. Abstract and architectural.

## What to Listen For
- How does this version create its own sense of forward motion?
- Where are the moments of tension and release?
- How does the melodic contour serve the overall aesthetic?

## How It Differs from Other Versions
| Version | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| A – Lyrical | The tune itself | Sparse, singing, space |
| B – Modern Triad Pairs | Tonality Vault | Continuous, architectural |
| C – Counterpoint | Linear independence | Two voices, contrary motion |
| D – Hybrid | Integration model | Combines all textures |

## Practice Suggestions
1. Play through slowly, focusing on tone and sustain
2. Analyze the intervallic content
3. Compare with other versions to understand textural contrasts
4. Use as a springboard for your own improvisations
