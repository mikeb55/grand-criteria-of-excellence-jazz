# CHAPTER 7: MONK'S DREAM

**Style:** Experimental (Thelonious Monk tribute) | **Key:** C Major | **Tempo:** 110 BPM | **Time:** 4/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Whole-tone clusters and displaced rhythms."*

Monk's Dream channels the angular, unpredictable genius of Thelonious Monk. The tune uses whole-tone scales, dissonant clusters, and deliberately "wrong" notes that become right through conviction. The key of C provides clarity for these adventures.

**Playing Tip:** Feel the space; don't rush the silence.

---

## THE FORM

16-bar form with Monk-style asymmetry:

```
| Cmaj7#11  | Cmaj7#11  | Db7#11    | Db7#11   |
| Dm7       | G7#5      | Cmaj7     | Eb7      |
| Ab7       | Db7       | Gb7       | B7       |
| Em7       | A7#11     | Dm7       | G7#9     |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Whole-tone movement**: C → Db → Eb → etc. (bar 1-2, 7-8)
2. **Tritone substitutions**: Ab7, Db7, Gb7, B7 create chromatic bass line
3. **Cluster voicings**: Close-voiced dissonances
4. **Rhythmic displacement**: Phrases start in unexpected places

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Monk Color |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Cmaj7#11 | C Lydian | Whole-tone moments |
| Db7#11 | Db Lydian Dominant | Same whole-tone as C |
| G7#5 | G Whole-Tone | Perfect for the harmony |
| Ab7 | Ab Mixolydian | Blues tinge |
| Dm7 | D Dorian | Standard bebop |
| G7#9 | G Half-Whole Dim | The Monk "crunch" |

### The Whole-Tone Scale

Both C and Db belong to the **same whole-tone scale**:
```
C - D - E - F# - G# - A# (- C)
```

This creates the floating, ambiguous quality Monk loved.

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Monk Flavor |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Cmaj7#11 | C Major | D Major | Lydian |
| G7#5 | G Augmented | Db Augmented | Whole-tone |
| Ab7 | Ab Major | Gb Major | Tritone approach |
| G7#9 | G Major | Ab Major | The "crunch" |

### The "Monk Pair"

Over G7#9, alternate between:
- G Major (G-B-D) = the resolution sound
- Ab Major (Ab-C-Eb) = the "wrong" note (#9, b5, b7)

The Ab Major triad is "wrong" but sounds inevitably right.

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Angular Melody (Version A)

**Concept:** Jagged, speech-like phrases with unexpected accents

- Phrases start on weak beats (beat 2, the "and" of 3)
- Wide leaps followed by steps
- Repeat notes with varying accents
- Long silences mid-phrase

**Monk Rhythmic Cells:**
```
| . . X . | X . . X | . X . . | X . X . |
(rest-rest-note-rest | note-rest-rest-note | etc.)
```

### Chorus 2: Whole-Tone Clusters (Version B)

**Concept:** Dissonant chord-melody using cluster voicings

- Voice chords in close position (2nds)
- Use the whole-tone scale for melodic connections
- "Smear" between chords chromatically
- Emphasize tritones and augmented 5ths

**Cluster Technique:**
```
Over Cmaj7#11: Play C-D-E-F# simultaneously (whole-tone cluster)
Over G7#5:     Play G-B-D# simultaneously (augmented chord)
```

### Chorus 3: Space and Silence (Version C)

**Concept:** Extreme use of silence as a compositional element

**Texture Map:**
| Bars | Activity | Silence |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1-2 | 3 notes | 6 beats rest |
| 3-4 | 2 notes | 7 beats rest |
| 5-8 | Burst of activity | Then 2 full bars rest |

Monk was famous for this—silence is as important as sound.

## VOICING REFERENCE

### Cluster Voicings (Monk-style)
```
Cmaj7#11:  x-3-2-4-3-x (close position)
           x-3-4-4-5-x (cluster: E-F#-G-B)

Db7#11:    x-4-3-4-4-x (tritone from C)
           x-4-5-5-6-x (cluster)

G7#5:      3-x-3-4-4-x (augmented)
G7#9:      3-x-3-4-4-4 (the crunch chord)
```

### Tritone Substitution Voicings
```
Ab7:       4-x-4-5-4-x
Db7:       x-4-3-4-4-x
Gb7:       2-x-2-3-2-x
B7:        x-2-1-2-2-x
```

## TECHNIQUE: RHYTHMIC DISPLACEMENT

### What Is Displacement?

Taking a phrase and starting it on a different beat:

**Original (on beat 1):**
```
| X X X X | . . . . |
```

**Displaced (on beat 2):**
```
| . X X X | X . . . |
```

**Displaced (on "and" of 3):**
```
| . . . X | X X X . |
```

### Practice Method

1. Write out a simple phrase
2. Play it starting on beat 1
3. Play it starting on beat 2
4. Play it starting on each 8th note position
5. Notice how the feel changes completely

---

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Thelonious Monk** — *Monk's Dream* (the original inspiration)
2. **Thelonious Monk** — *Brilliant Corners* (angular genius)
3. **Thelonious Monk** — *Solo Monk* (pure piano, essential)
4. **Monk with John Coltrane** — *Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane*
5. **Steve Lacy** — *Reflections* (Monk repertoire on soprano)

## THE MONK APPROACH

### "Wrong" Notes

Monk's "wrong" notes aren't mistakes—they're choices:
- The b9 against a major chord
- The #11 emphasized as a melody note
- The major 7th against a dominant 7th

Play these notes with **conviction**, not apology.

### Space

Monk's rests are composed, not accidental:
- A rest can be 2 beats, 4 beats, even 8 beats
- The silence creates tension
- The next note releases it

### Rhythm

Monk's time feel is unique:
- Slightly behind the beat
- Accents on unexpected places
- Phrases that don't line up with bar lines

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Playing too many notes**: Monk's genius is in what he leaves out
2. **Avoiding dissonance**: Embrace the clusters and "wrong" notes
3. **Rushing silences**: A 2-beat rest should feel like 2 beats, not 1.5
4. **Being too "correct"**: This tune requires controlled chaos
5. **Losing the pulse**: The time should be solid even when phrases float

---

## THE "MONK'S DREAM" CONCEPT

The title refers to Monk's unique musical vision:
- **Dream**: Non-linear logic, like dream sequence
- **Monk**: Angular, unexpected, but inevitable
- **The journey**: From C Lydian to chromatic abstraction and back

When playing this tune, think in curves, not straight lines.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Do my "wrong" notes sound intentional?
- [ ] Am I using silence effectively?
- [ ] Are my clusters voiced correctly (close position)?
- [ ] Do my phrases start on unexpected beats?
- [ ] Does the whole thing swing (despite the oddness)?
