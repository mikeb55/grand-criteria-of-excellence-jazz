# CHAPTER 4: SAO PAULO RAIN

**Style:** Bossa Nova | **Key:** D Major | **Tempo:** 130 BPM | **Time:** 4/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Melodic minor shapes over static pedal points."*

Sao Paulo Rain captures the sophisticated melancholy of Brazilian music. The bossa nova rhythm provides a gentle propulsion while the melody floats above static pedal tones. The key of D major allows for rich open-string voicings.

**Playing Tip:** Keep the rhythm steady; let the melody float above it.

## THE FORM

32-bar AABA form:

```
A Section (8 bars):
| Dmaj9   | Dmaj9   | Em9     | Em9     |
| F#m7    | Bm7     | Em9     | A7sus4  |

B Section (8 bars):
| Ebmaj7  | Ebmaj7  | Abmaj7  | Abmaj7  |
| Dm7     | G7      | Cmaj7   | A7alt   |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Pedal point**: D in the bass anchors the A sections
2. **Modal interchange**: Ebmaj7 (bII) creates characteristic bossa color
3. **Melodic minor**: F#m7 suggests D melodic minor flavor
4. **Chromatic approach**: Ebmaj7 → Abmaj7 → return to D

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Bossa Flavor |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Dmaj9 | D Lydian | Natural 7, #11 brightness |
| Em9 | E Dorian | Characteristic bossa ii chord |
| F#m7 | F# Phrygian | Dark, Spanish tinge |
| Ebmaj7 | Eb Lydian | Floating bII color |
| Abmaj7 | Ab Lydian | Distant relation |
| A7alt | A Altered | Tension before resolution |

### Melodic Minor Connection

Over the A section with D pedal:
- Use **D melodic minor** (D-E-F-F#-G-A-B-C#)
- The F natural creates subtle tension against Dmaj9
- Resolves beautifully to F# on the F#m7

## THE BOSSA RHYTHM

### The Fundamental Pattern
```
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
LH: X . . X . . X .  (bass notes)
RH: . X . . X . X .  (chord stabs)
```

### Guitar Adaptation
```
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
B:  X . . X . . X .  (thumb on bass)
T:  . X . . X . X .  (fingers on treble)
```

Practice this pattern slowly until it becomes second nature.

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Brazilian Sound |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Dmaj9 | D Major | E Major | 9, #11, 6 = Lydian bossa |
| Em9 | E Minor | G Major | Natural Dorian |
| F#m7 | F# Minor | A Major | Minor with 6 |
| Ebmaj7 | Eb Major | F Major | Lydian color |

### Pattern: The "Jobim Cell"

This melodic pattern captures the bossa essence:
```
Scale degree: 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 | 6 - 5 - 3 - 2 |
Over Dmaj9:   D - E - F# - A | B - A - F# - E |
```

Simple, elegant, and endlessly variable.

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Lyrical Melody (Version A)

**Concept:** Singing, Jobim-inspired melody

- Long tones on chord tones (1, 3, 5)
- Chromatic approach notes into target notes
- Phrases that breathe with the bossa rhythm
- The melody should sound like it has Portuguese lyrics

**Shape:** Arch-like phrases—rise in the first half, fall in the second.

### Chorus 2: Melodic Minor Colors (Version B)

**Concept:** Modern harmonies using melodic minor modes

- Over Dmaj9: Use D melodic minor (F natural creates tension)
- Over Em9: Use E Dorian
- Over the B section: Lydian augmented colors on Ebmaj7

**Intervallic Focus:** Major and minor 6ths—the most "Brazilian" intervals.

### Chorus 3: Melody + Bass Counterpoint (Version C)

**Concept:** Simultaneous melody and walking bass

**Texture:**
- **Bass**: Root motion on beats 1 and 3
- **Melody**: Rhythmically independent on strings 1-2

This is challenging—start very slowly (60 BPM).

## TECHNIQUE: THE BOSSA TOUCH

### Right Hand Position
- Thumb handles strings 4-6 (bass)
- Index, middle, ring handle strings 1-3 (chords/melody)
- Keep the wrist relaxed—no tension

### The Attack
- Soft, rounded tone—not too bright
- Let bass notes sustain while treble notes are shorter
- No hard accents except on beat 2

### Pedal Tone Technique
On the A section, keep D droning in the bass while the chords change:
```
Dmaj9:  x-5-4-6-5-x (D on 5th fret, 5th string)
Em9:    x-5-5-4-0-0 (D still in bass!)
```

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: The Rhythm
- [ ] Master the basic bossa pattern (hands separate)
- [ ] Combine hands at slow tempo
- [ ] Practice with a metronome clicking on 2 and 4

### Week 2: The Melody
- [ ] Learn Version A melody
- [ ] Practice singing while playing the bossa pattern
- [ ] Work on phrase breathing

### Week 3: Melodic Minor
- [ ] Drill D melodic minor over the A section
- [ ] Practice 6th intervals (major and minor)
- [ ] Work on Version B

### Week 4: Counterpoint
- [ ] Isolate the bass line
- [ ] Add melody one note at a time
- [ ] Very slowly combine (start at 50 BPM)

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **João Gilberto** — *Getz/Gilberto* (the definitive bossa guitar)
2. **Antonio Carlos Jobim** — *Wave* (compositional models)
3. **Baden Powell** — *Os Afro Sambas* (guitar virtuosity)
4. **Pat Metheny** — *Letter from Home* (modern interpretation)

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Rushing beat 4**: The "+4" should feel relaxed, not anticipatory
2. **Heavy bass**: The thumb should be gentle, not thumping
3. **Ignoring the pedal**: The D drone is essential to the A section
4. **Too loud**: Bossa is intimate—play at conversation volume

---

## CULTURAL NOTE

Bossa Nova emerged in late-1950s Rio de Janeiro, blending samba rhythms with jazz harmony. The word "bossa" means "flair" or "style." 

The music reflects a sophisticated urbanity—the sound of beachside cafes, not concert halls. Keep this intimacy in mind when playing Sao Paulo Rain.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Is my bossa rhythm consistent and relaxed?
- [ ] Can I sing the melody while comping?
- [ ] Does the D pedal sustain through the A section?
- [ ] Is my touch soft and rounded?
