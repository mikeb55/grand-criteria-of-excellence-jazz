# CHAPTER 2: ORBIT

**Style:** Wayne Shorter (Avant) | **Key:** F Major | **Tempo:** 160 BPM | **Time:** 3/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Non-functional harmony over a floating pulse."*

Orbit channels the mysterious, spacious quality of Wayne Shorter's compositions. The waltz time signature (3/4) creates a lilting, orbital motion while the harmony deliberately avoids traditional V-I resolutions.

**Playing Tip:** Let the intervals ring; prioritize sustain over speed.

## THE FORM

16-bar form with through-composed feel:

```
| Fmaj7#11 | Ebmaj7#5 | Dbmaj7   | Bmaj7    |
| Bbm9     | Abmaj7   | Gbmaj7   | Emaj7    |
| Fmaj7#11 | Dbmaj7   | Amaj7    | Gmaj7    |
| Fmaj7#11 | Ebm9     | Dbmaj7   | Fmaj7    |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Non-functional movement**: Chords relate by interval, not by resolution
2. **Major 7th dominance**: Almost every chord is a major 7th variant
3. **Chromatic root motion**: F → Eb → Db → B (descending chromatic)
4. **Symmetry**: Bar 1 material returns in bars 9 and 13

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Color Note |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Fmaj7#11 | F Lydian | B natural (#11) |
| Ebmaj7#5 | Eb Lydian Augmented | B natural + G# |
| Dbmaj7 | Db Lydian | G natural (#11) |
| Bmaj7 | B Lydian | E# (#11) |
| Bbm9 | Bb Dorian | G natural (6th) |
| Emaj7 | E Lydian | A# (#11) |

### Shorter's Approach

Wayne Shorter often uses **Lydian as default** for major 7th chords. The #11 creates a floating, unresolved quality that defines this style.

---

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Creates |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Fmaj7#11 | F Major | G Major | Lydian color (9, #11, 6) |
| Ebmaj7#5 | Eb Augmented | Bb Major | Augmented + Lydian |
| Dbmaj7 | Db Major | Eb Major | 9, #11 |
| Bbm9 | Db Major | Ab Major | Minor 9 sound |

### Pattern: Lydian Triad Pair

Over Fmaj7#11:
```
F-A-C (Imaj) → G-B-D (IImaj) → F-A-C...
```

The G Major triad provides B natural (the #11) and D (the 6th).

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Lyrical (Version A)

**Concept:** Floating, long-tone melody

- Emphasize the 3/4 pulse gently—avoid heavy downbeats
- Use half notes and dotted half notes
- Let phrases span across bar lines
- Target chord tones on beats 1 and 3

**Motif:** Ascending perfect 4th (like planets in orbit)

### Chorus 2: Modern Interval Lines (Version B)

**Concept:** Wide intervals, Shorter-style angularity

- Major 7ths and minor 9ths between successive notes
- Avoid stepwise motion
- Create tension through silence—use rests strategically

**Example over Fmaj7#11:**
```
E (maj7) → F (8va up) → B (#11) → C (5th, 8vb)
```

### Chorus 3: Parallel Motion Counterpoint (Version C)

**Concept:** Two voices moving in parallel motion (unusual!)

Unlike Blue Cycle's contrary motion, Orbit uses **parallel 4ths and 5ths**:
- Top voice: Melody
- Bottom voice: Perfect 4th or 5th below

This creates a medieval, modal quality appropriate to Shorter's cosmic aesthetic.

## VOICING REFERENCE

### Quartal Voicings (Shorter-style)
```
Fmaj7#11: x-x-3-4-5-5 (stacked 4ths: C-F-B-E)
Ebmaj7#5: x-6-5-4-4-x (Eb with G# tension)
Dbmaj7:   x-4-5-5-6-x (with Lydian #11)
```

### Wide Drop-2 Voicings
```
Fmaj7:  1-x-2-2-1-x (root position)
Bmaj7:  7-x-8-8-7-x (root position)
```

---

## THE 3/4 FEEL

### Counting the Waltz

Internalize the pulse as:
- **ONE**-two-three, **ONE**-two-three
- Not: one-TWO-three (avoid polka feel)

### Phrase Lengths

In 3/4, natural phrase lengths are:
- 2 bars = 6 beats (short phrase)
- 4 bars = 12 beats (standard phrase)
- 8 bars = 24 beats (extended phrase)

Let your lines follow these natural groupings.

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: The Float
- [ ] Learn Version A melody with extreme sustain
- [ ] Practice letting notes ring into each other
- [ ] Use volume swells for dynamics

### Week 2: Intervals
- [ ] Drill major 7th intervals in all positions
- [ ] Practice minor 9th jumps
- [ ] Work on Version B slowly (80 BPM)

### Week 3: Parallel Motion
- [ ] Practice parallel 4ths ascending and descending
- [ ] Add the melody as top voice
- [ ] Work on Version C

### Week 4: Synthesis
- [ ] Connect all three choruses
- [ ] Develop your own phrasing within the form
- [ ] Record with a 3/4 drum loop

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Wayne Shorter** — *Speak No Evil* (the blueprint)
2. **Wayne Shorter** — *JuJu* (more floating harmony)
3. **Herbie Hancock** — *Maiden Voyage* (related aesthetic)
4. **Kenny Wheeler** — *Gnu High* (ECM-style space)

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Forcing resolution**: Don't try to make the chords "go somewhere"
2. **Heavy accents**: Keep the 3/4 light and floating
3. **Too many notes**: Space is essential in this style
4. **Ignoring sustain**: Shorter's melodies sing—don't chop notes short

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Does my playing have a floating quality?
- [ ] Can I hear the major 7th chords as "home" (not needing resolution)?
- [ ] Are my phrases breathing naturally in 3/4?
- [ ] Is there enough space between ideas?
