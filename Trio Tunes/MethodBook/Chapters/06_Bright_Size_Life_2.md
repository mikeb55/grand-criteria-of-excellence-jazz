# CHAPTER 6: BRIGHT SIZE LIFE 2

**Style:** Pat Metheny | **Key:** D Major | **Tempo:** 145 BPM | **Time:** 4/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Triad pairs moving constantly over a pedal."*

Named in tribute to Pat Metheny's landmark album, this tune captures his signature sound: bright, flowing lines over pedal tones with constant harmonic motion. The key of D allows extensive use of open strings, creating the characteristic "ringing" Metheny texture.

**Playing Tip:** Play with a light, fluid touch; no hard accents.

---

## THE FORM

32-bar form with pedal-point A sections:

```
A Section (8 bars) - D Pedal:
| Dmaj7   | Em7/D   | F#m7/D  | Gmaj7/D |
| Dmaj7   | A/D     | Bm7/D   | Asus4   |

B Section (8 bars) - Moving Bass:
| Bbmaj7  | Cmaj7   | Ebmaj7  | Fmaj7   |
| Abmaj7  | Bbmaj7  | Dbmaj7  | A7sus4  |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **D pedal**: Entire A section has D in the bass
2. **Major 7th cycle**: B section moves through distant major 7ths
3. **Pentatonic melodies**: Strong emphasis on D major pentatonic
4. **Lydian colors**: Many chords suggest Lydian (#11) sonority

---

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Metheny Color |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Dmaj7 | D Lydian | #11 (G#) for brightness |
| Em7/D | E Dorian | Natural 6 (C#) |
| F#m7/D | F# Phrygian | Dark but over bright D |
| Bbmaj7 | Bb Lydian | E natural (#11) |
| Ebmaj7 | Eb Lydian | A natural (#11) |
| Dbmaj7 | Db Lydian | G natural (#11) |

### The Metheny Sound

Pat Metheny builds lines from:
- **Pentatonic scales** as the core
- **Lydian extensions** for color
- **Arpeggiated triads** in constant motion
- **Open strings** for sustain and resonance

---

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Metheny Application |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Dmaj7 | D Major | E Major | 9, #11, 6 = Lydian |
| Em7/D | E Minor | G Major | Dorian color |
| Bbmaj7 | Bb Major | C Major | Lydian |
| Ebmaj7 | Eb Major | F Major | Lydian |

### The "Metheny Pattern"

Over Dmaj7, this pattern captures the sound:
```
D - F# - A - E - G# - B - D - E
(D maj)     (E maj)     (return)
```

Continuous eighth notes, light articulation, ringing sustain.

---

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Lyrical Pentatonic (Version A)

**Concept:** Singing melodies using major pentatonic

- Core notes: D - E - F# - A - B (D major pentatonic)
- Add C# for Lydian moments
- Phrases should arc naturally—up then down
- Target chord tones on downbeats

**Phrase Shape:**
```
Bars 1-2: Ascending (question)
Bars 3-4: Descending (answer)
Bars 5-8: Development and resolution
```

### Chorus 2: Constant Triad Motion (Version B)

**Concept:** Non-stop triad arpeggiation

- Use the D/E triad pair over the A section
- B section: New triad pair for each chord
- Continuous eighth notes—never stop moving
- Slight accents on chord changes only

**Pattern:**
```
| D triad up | E triad down | D triad up | E triad down |
```

### Chorus 3: Pedal Point Counterpoint (Version C)

**Concept:** Open D drone with independent melody

**Texture:**
- **Bass**: Open D string (continuous)
- **Melody**: Arpeggiated lines on upper strings

This creates a "harp-like" effect characteristic of Metheny's acoustic work.

## VOICING REFERENCE

### Pedal Point Voicings
```
Dmaj7:    x-5-4-6-5-x or 0-5-4-6-5-x (open D)
Em7/D:    0-5-4-5-5-x (D in bass)
F#m7/D:   0-x-4-6-5-x (D in bass)
Gmaj7/D:  0-5-4-4-3-x (D in bass)
A/D:      0-5-4-6-5-x (A triad over D)
```

### B Section Voicings
```
Bbmaj7:   x-1-0-2-3-x (first position)
Cmaj7:    x-3-2-4-5-x 
Ebmaj7:   x-6-5-7-8-x
Dbmaj7:   x-4-3-5-6-x
Abmaj7:   4-x-5-5-4-x
```

## TECHNIQUE: THE METHENY TOUCH

### Right Hand
- **Light attack**: The pick barely touches the string
- **Follow-through**: Let the pick glide through, not chop
- **Consistent dynamics**: Every note at the same level
- **Slight palm muting**: For the characteristic "thump"

### Left Hand
- **Legato**: Use hammer-ons and pull-offs liberally
- **Let ring**: Don't dampen notes prematurely
- **Finger independence**: Melody moves while drone sustains

### The "Ringing" Effect
Use open strings whenever possible:
```
Over Dmaj7:  D (open) - F# (string 1, fret 2) - A (open) - E (open)
```

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: Pentatonic Foundation
- [ ] Master D major pentatonic in all positions
- [ ] Add C# for Lydian extension
- [ ] Practice Version A melody

### Week 2: Triad Pairs
- [ ] Drill D/E major triad pair
- [ ] Apply to the entire A section
- [ ] Work on Version B at slow tempo (80 BPM)

### Week 3: Pedal Technique
- [ ] Practice maintaining open D while playing melody
- [ ] Work on independence between bass and treble
- [ ] Develop Version C

### Week 4: The Flow
- [ ] Play all three choruses consecutively
- [ ] Work on consistent dynamics (no accents)
- [ ] Practice with a delay pedal (dotted eighth)

---

## DELAY SETTINGS

The "Metheny delay" is essential for this sound:

| Parameter | Setting |
|:---|:---|
| Time | Dotted eighth (562ms at 145 BPM) |
| Feedback | 2-3 repeats |
| Mix | 30-40% wet |
| Type | Analog or tape emulation |

The delay creates rhythmic complexity from simple lines.

---

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Pat Metheny** — *Bright Size Life* (the original)
2. **Pat Metheny Group** — *Offramp* (group sound)
3. **Pat Metheny** — *One Quiet Night* (solo acoustic)
4. **Pat Metheny & Charlie Haden** — *Beyond the Missouri Sky*
5. **Lyle Mays** — *Lyle Mays* (Metheny's keyboard partner)

---

## TONE TIPS

For the Metheny sound:
- **Guitar**: Hollowbody or semi-hollow (Gibson ES-175, Ibanez PM)
- **Amp**: Roland JC-120 or similar clean solid-state
- **Delay**: Essential—dotted eighth
- **Chorus**: Optional, light modulation
- **Compression**: Light, for sustain

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Accenting notes**: Keep dynamics absolutely even
2. **Losing the pedal**: The D should ring throughout
3. **Too stiff**: The lines should flow like water
4. **Overusing delay**: The delay enhances, but the playing must be clean
5. **Wrong triad pair**: D/E for A section, new pair each chord in B

---

## THE "BRIGHT SIZE" CONCEPT

The title refers to the expansive, optimistic quality of the music:
- **Bright**: Major tonality, open strings, ringing sustain
- **Size**: Wide intervallic range, sense of space
- **Life**: Forward motion, continuous flow

Think of sunlight on water—constant movement, unchanging brightness.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Are my dynamics completely even?
- [ ] Does the D pedal sustain throughout the A section?
- [ ] Can I play continuous eighth notes without tension?
- [ ] Does my delay sound musical (not cluttered)?
- [ ] Is there a sense of flow and forward motion?
