# CHAPTER 8: NEFERTITI'S SHADOW

**Style:** Wayne Shorter (Post-Bop) | **Key:** Eb Major | **Tempo:** 180 BPM | **Time:** 4/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Melody dictates harmony; no recurring V7s."*

Named after Shorter's famous composition "Nefertiti," this tune reverses traditional jazz hierarchy: the melody is paramount, and the harmony exists to serve it. There are no traditional ii-V-I progressions—the chords flow from the melodic contour.

**Playing Tip:** Listen to the top note; harmonization flows down from there.

---

## THE FORM

16-bar through-composed form:

```
| Ebmaj7#11 | Dbmaj7    | Bmaj7     | Amaj7     |
| Abmaj7    | Gbmaj7    | Emaj7     | Dmaj7     |
| Cmaj7     | Bbmaj7    | Abmaj7    | Gbmaj7    |
| Fmaj7     | Ebmaj7    | Dbmaj7    | Ebmaj7    |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Descending major 7ths**: Root movement by major 2nds and minor 3rds
2. **No dominants**: Every chord is major 7th—no V7 resolutions
3. **Melody-derived**: Each chord supports a specific melody note
4. **Cycling**: Returns to Eb through unexpected routes

---

## SCALE PALETTE

Every chord uses **Lydian** as the default:

| Chord | Scale | #11 Note |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Ebmaj7 | Eb Lydian | A natural |
| Dbmaj7 | Db Lydian | G natural |
| Bmaj7 | B Lydian | E# (F) |
| Amaj7 | A Lydian | D# |
| Emaj7 | E Lydian | A# |
| Cmaj7 | C Lydian | F# |

### Shorter's Harmonic World

Wayne Shorter's post-bop harmony features:
- **Major 7ths as stable sounds** (not requiring resolution)
- **Root movement by step** (not by 5th)
- **Lydian as default** (not Ionian)
- **Melody as generator** (harmony serves melody)

---

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Lydian Sound |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Ebmaj7 | Eb Major | F Major | 9, #11, 6 |
| Dbmaj7 | Db Major | Eb Major | 9, #11, 6 |
| Bmaj7 | B Major | C# Major | Lydian |
| Amaj7 | A Major | B Major | Lydian |

### Universal Pattern

For any maj7 chord, use:
- **Root triad** (1-3-5)
- **II triad** (9-#11-6)

Example over Ebmaj7:
```
Eb-G-Bb (Eb major) + F-A-C (F major) = Eb Lydian sound
```

---

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: The Singing Melody (Version A)

**Concept:** Long, arching phrases that generate the harmony

- The melody should be singable, like a vocal line
- Each phrase targets a specific chord tone
- Phrases cross bar lines freely
- The tempo is fast (180), but the feel is floating

**Melodic Contour:**
```
Bars 1-4:   Descending arc
Bars 5-8:   Ascending response
Bars 9-12:  Development (wider intervals)
Bars 13-16: Return and resolution
```

### Chorus 2: Lydian Triad Pairs (Version B)

**Concept:** Continuous eighth notes using I/II triad pairs

- At 180 BPM, eighth notes are fast but manageable
- Alternate between root triad and II triad
- Maintain the melodic contour while using pairs
- Accents only on chord changes

**Pattern Application:**
```
Bar 1 (Ebmaj7): Eb-G-Bb (down) - F-A-C (up) - repeat
Bar 2 (Dbmaj7): Db-F-Ab (down) - Eb-G-Bb (up) - repeat
```

### Chorus 3: Parallel Voice-Leading (Version C)

**Concept:** Two voices moving in parallel major 3rds or 6ths

**Texture:**
- **Top voice**: Melody
- **Bottom voice**: Major 3rd or 6th below (parallel motion)

This creates a sweet, consonant quality appropriate to the major 7th harmony.

## VOICING REFERENCE

### Major 7th Shapes (moveable)
```
Type A:  x-X-X-X-X-x  (Root on 5th string)
Ebmaj7:  x-6-5-7-8-x
Dbmaj7:  x-4-3-5-6-x
Bmaj7:   x-2-1-3-4-x

Type B:  X-x-X-X-X-x  (Root on 6th string)
Amaj7:   5-x-6-6-5-x
Gmaj7:   3-x-4-4-3-x
Emaj7:   0-x-1-1-0-x (open position)
```

### Parallel 3rds/6ths Voicings
```
Eb + G:   x-x-8-8-x-x (parallel 3rds)
Db + F:   x-x-6-6-x-x
B + D#:   x-x-4-4-x-x
```

## TECHNIQUE: PLAYING AT 180 BPM

### Time Feel

At 180 BPM:
- Quarter note = 333ms
- Eighth note = 167ms
- Sixteenth = 83ms

Focus on **steady eighth notes** as your primary rhythmic unit.

### Subdivision Practice

1. Set metronome to 90 BPM (half-time)
2. Play eighth notes (which feel like 180)
3. Gradually move click to 180 (one click per beat)
4. Eventually, click on 1 and 3 only (half-time feel at fast tempo)

### Relaxation

At fast tempos, tension is the enemy:
- Relax shoulders
- Minimal finger movement
- Let the momentum carry you
- Don't "work hard"—let it flow

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: The Melody
- [ ] Learn Version A melody by heart
- [ ] Practice singing the melody
- [ ] Work at half tempo (90 BPM)

### Week 2: Lydian Pairs
- [ ] Master the I/II triad pair for each chord
- [ ] Practice transitions between pairs
- [ ] Work on Version B at 120 BPM

### Week 3: Parallel Motion
- [ ] Practice parallel 3rds through the changes
- [ ] Practice parallel 6ths through the changes
- [ ] Develop Version C

### Week 4: Full Speed
- [ ] Bring everything up to 180 BPM
- [ ] Focus on relaxation and flow
- [ ] Record and evaluate

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Wayne Shorter** — *Speak No Evil* ("Nefertiti" is on this album)
2. **Wayne Shorter** — *Adam's Apple*
3. **Miles Davis** — *Nefertiti* (the album featuring Shorter's tune)
4. **Herbie Hancock** — *Maiden Voyage* (similar aesthetic)
5. **Wayne Shorter Quartet** — *Without a Net* (modern Shorter)

## THE "NEFERTITI" APPROACH

Wayne Shorter's "Nefertiti" (1967) revolutionized jazz composition:
- The **melody repeats** while the rhythm section improvises
- The **form is secondary** to the melodic statement
- **Harmony serves melody**, not the other way around

This tune applies those principles to guitar:
- The melody is primary
- The chords are chosen to harmonize specific melody notes
- No functional progressions—just beautiful sounds

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Thinking harmonically first**: Start with the melody, always
2. **Adding dominants**: There are no V7 chords—respect the maj7 world
3. **Rushing at 180**: Stay relaxed; let the tempo carry you
4. **Ignoring the contour**: The descending-ascending shape is essential
5. **Over-complicating**: Lydian is enough—don't add more colors

---

## THE SHADOW CONCEPT

The title "Nefertiti's Shadow" suggests:
- **Mystery**: Egyptian queen, ancient beauty
- **Silhouette**: The melody is the outline; harmony is the shadow
- **Following**: The chords follow the melody, like a shadow follows the body

When playing, imagine the melody as a figure walking, and the harmony as its shadow on the wall.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Can I sing the melody without the guitar?
- [ ] Does every chord support its specific melody note?
- [ ] Am I relaxed at 180 BPM?
- [ ] Does the Lydian color come through clearly?
- [ ] Is the parallel motion smooth and sweet?
