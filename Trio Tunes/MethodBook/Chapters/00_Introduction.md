## HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

### The Four Lead Sheet Variations

Each tune in this collection comes with **four distinct lead sheet versions**:

| Version | Name | Focus |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **A** | Lyrical | Melodic, singable lines with clear phrase structures |
| **B** | Modern | Triad pairs, wide intervals, contemporary harmony |
| **C** | Counterpoint | Two-voice writing (Wyble-inspired independence) |
| **D** | Hybrid | Combines elements from A, B, and C |

### Practice Flow

1. **Learn the Melody** (Version A) — Internalize the form and phrasing
2. **Study the Harmony** — Work through chord voicings and scale palettes
3. **Apply Triad Pairs** (Version B) — Modern melodic language
4. **Develop Independence** (Version C) — Two-voice counterpoint
5. **Integrate** (Version D) — Combine all approaches organically

## CORE CONCEPTS

### 1. Melody-Derived Harmony (MDH)

Every chord in these etudes exists to **support the melody**. The harmony isn't arbitrary—it's generated from the melodic content. When practicing, always sing or hear the melody in your head, even when working through voicings.

### 2. Triad Pair System

We use a consistent **Stable + Color Triad** approach:
- **Stable Triad**: Contains chord tones (1, 3, 5)
- **Color Triad**: Adds tensions (7, 9, 11, 13, alterations)

Example over Cmaj7:
- Stable: C Major (C-E-G)
- Color: D Major (D-F#-A) — provides 9, #11, 13

### 3. Jimmy Wyble Counterpoint

Inspired by the legendary Jimmy Wyble, these etudes feature **independent two-voice writing**:
- Top voice: Melody (often sustained)
- Bottom voice: Counter-melody or walking line
- Goal: Each voice should be singable independently

### 4. Barry Harris Harmonic Approach

Several tunes incorporate Barry Harris's **6th Diminished Scale** logic:
- Major 6 Diminished: 1-2-3-4-5-b6-6-7
- Minor 6 Diminished: 1-2-b3-3-4-5-6-b7
- Creates smooth, bebop-style voice leading
