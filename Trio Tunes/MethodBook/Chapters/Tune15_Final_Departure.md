|:------|:------|
| **M1** | Opening questions |
| **M6** | Final resolution (essential) |
| **M7** | Textural space |

### Dominant DNA
- **M6 (Resolution):** 45% — This tune IS resolution
- **M1 (Question):** 25% — Contrasting moments
- **Expressive DNA:** Hall, Frisell, lyrical

# COUNTERPOINT IN VOICINGS

### Voice Leading Focus
Each voice in the drop-2 chord should move smoothly:
```
DbMaj9 → Bbm9:
Soprano: Db → Db (common tone)
Alto:    Ab → Ab (common tone)
Tenor:   F  → F  (common tone)
Bass:    Db → Bb (step down)
```

Maximize common tones, minimize movement.
