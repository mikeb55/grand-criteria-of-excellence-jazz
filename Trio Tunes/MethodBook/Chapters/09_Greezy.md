# CHAPTER 9: GREEZY

**Style:** Blues Shuffle | **Key:** G Major | **Tempo:** 100 BPM | **Time:** 12/8

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Traditional shuffle with modern diminished substitutions."*

Greezy is the greasiest tune in the collection—a down-home blues shuffle in 12/8 with modern harmonic twists. The diminished substitutions add unexpected color while keeping the deep blues feel intact.

**Playing Tip:** Lock with the imaginary drummer's triplet feel. Feel the grease.

---

## THE FORM

12-bar blues with diminished substitutions:

```
| G7       | C7       | G7       | G7  G#dim7 |
| C7       | C#dim7   | G7       | E7         |
| Am7      | D7#9     | G7  E7   | Am7  D7    |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **12/8 shuffle**: Triplet subdivision throughout
2. **Diminished connectors**: G#dim7 and C#dim7 as chromatic passing chords
3. **#9 dominants**: D7#9 for the classic blues "crunch"
4. **Quick changes**: Bars 4, 11, 12 have two chords each

---

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Blues Option |
|:---|:---|:---|
| G7 | G Mixolydian | G Blues |
| C7 | C Mixolydian | C Blues |
| G#dim7 | G# Half-Whole Diminished | — |
| C#dim7 | C# Half-Whole Diminished | — |
| E7 | E Mixolydian | E Blues |
| D7#9 | D Half-Whole Diminished | D Blues |

### The Blues Scale Kingdom

Over the whole form, you can use **G Blues** (G-Bb-C-Db-D-F) as a "master scale":
- Works over G7, C7, D7
- Creates delicious tension over E7
- Even works over diminished chords (with adjustment)

---

## THE 12/8 FEEL

### Understanding 12/8

12/8 means **12 eighth notes per bar**, grouped in **four groups of three**:
```
| 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 | 7 8 9 | 10 11 12 |
| 1 . . | 2 . . | 3 . . | 4  .  .  |
```

Each beat has a triplet subdivision built in.

### The Shuffle vs. 12/8

- **Shuffle**: 4/4 with swung eighths (triplet interpretation)
- **12/8**: Triplets are explicitly written

They sound similar, but 12/8 is more "greasy"—the triplets are heavier.

---

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Blues Sound |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| G7 | G Major | F Major | Mixolydian |
| G7 | Bb Minor | G Major | Blues minor/major |
| C7 | C Major | Bb Major | Mixolydian |
| D7#9 | D Major | Eb Major | The crunch |

### The "Greezy Pair"

Over G7, alternate:
- **G Major** (G-B-D) = bright
- **Bb Minor** (Bb-Db-F) = dark, bluesy (contains b3, b5, b7 of G)

This major/minor ambiguity is the essence of blues.

---

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Classic Blues (Version A)

**Concept:** Traditional blues vocabulary with triplet phrasing

- Start phrases on beat 2 or 4
- Bends on the b3, 4, and b7
- Call and response structure
- Leave space for the "church"

**Classic Licks:**
```
(in G Blues)
e|----------------3-3-|
B|----3-5-3-------3---|
G|---------5-3-5------|
D|--5-----------------|
```

### Chorus 2: Diminished Connections (Version B)

**Concept:** Use diminished arpeggios as chromatic connectors

- Over G#dim7: G#-B-D-F arpeggio (connects G7 to Am7 sound)
- Over C#dim7: C#-E-G-Bb arpeggio (connects C7 to D7 sound)
- Diminished arpeggios resolve by half-step

**Diminished Pattern:**
```
G#dim7: G#-B-D-F (down) resolving to G or A
C#dim7: C#-E-G-Bb (down) resolving to D
```

### Chorus 3: Two-Voice Blues (Version C)

**Concept:** Bass line against melody, blues style

**Texture:**
- **Bass**: Root notes on beats 1 and 3 (in triplet grouping)
- **Melody**: Blues licks on the off-beats

This creates a "one-man-band" effect, common in solo blues guitar.

## TECHNIQUE: THE SHUFFLE FEEL

### Right Hand

- **Downstrokes on beats 1, 2, 3, 4** (the big beats)
- **Upstrokes on the triplet "3"** (the swing)
- Think: **DOWN-down-UP, DOWN-down-UP**

### Left Hand

- **Muting**: Control unwanted strings
- **Grace notes**: Quick hammer-ons/pull-offs for grease
- **Bends**: Slow, vocal bends are essential

### The "Pocket"

Play slightly **behind** the beat:
- Don't rush
- Let the groove breathe
- The bass player and drummer are your reference

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **BB King** — *Live at the Regal* (the master)
2. **Freddie King** — *Getting Ready* (Texas shuffle)
3. **Albert King** — *Born Under a Bad Sign* (slow grease)
4. **Stevie Ray Vaughan** — *Texas Flood* (modern blues)
5. **Robben Ford** — *Talk to Your Daughter* (jazz-blues)

---

## TONE TIPS

For the blues shuffle sound:
- **Guitar**: Anything with humbuckers (or single-coils with attitude)
- **Amp**: Just breaking up, but not fully distorted
- **No effects**: Maybe a touch of reverb
- **Fingers**: Dig in with the pick; don't be polite

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Rushing the shuffle**: Stay behind the beat
2. **Ignoring the diminished**: These are the "modern" touches—use them
3. **Too many notes**: Blues is about feel, not quantity
4. **Stiff bends**: Bends should be slow, vocal, expressive
5. **Losing the triplet**: Every beat is divided in three—feel it

---

## THE "GREEZY" CONCEPT

The title is intentional slang:
- **Greasy**: Smooth, slippery, funky
- **Easy**: Relaxed, in the pocket
- **Greezy**: The combination—effortless funk

When playing this tune, imagine you're cooking:
- Low heat (don't rush)
- Good ingredients (strong vocabulary)
- Let it simmer (space between phrases)

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Is my shuffle feel solid and relaxed?
- [ ] Do I use the diminished chords as connectors?
- [ ] Are my bends in tune and expressive?
- [ ] Can I play bass and melody simultaneously?
- [ ] Does it feel "greezy"?
