# THE CONCEPT

The Void is complete freedom:
- **No fixed harmony:** Create your own
- **No tempo:** Time is elastic
- **Textural focus:** Sound, not notes
- **Extended techniques:** Explore the guitar's possibilities

---

# STRUCTURAL SUGGESTIONS

Since there are no fixed chords, here's a performance framework:

```
Section 1: EMERGENCE (2-3 min)
- Begin from silence
- Volume swells, harmonics
- Gradually introduce pitch

Section 2: DEVELOPMENT (3-5 min)  
- Build density
- Explore extended techniques
- Create tension

Section 3: CLIMAX (1-2 min)
- Maximum intensity
- Dense textures

Section 4: DISSOLUTION (2-3 min)
- Gradual reduction
- Return to silence
```

1. **Harmonics:** Natural and artificial
2. **Behind the nut:** Pitchless sounds
3. **Body percussion:** Tap the guitar
4. **Prepared guitar:** Objects on strings
5. **E-bow/sustain:** Infinite sustain
6. **Feedback:** Controlled

# MOTIF USAGE

| Motif | Usage |
|:------|:------|

# IMPROVISATION GUIDELINES

### Textural Vocabulary
- **Density levels:** Sparse → Medium → Dense → Sparse
- **Dynamic arc:** pp → ff → pp
- **Pitch content:** From noise to clear tones

### Questions to Ask While Playing
1. What is the current density?
2. Where am I in the arc?
3. What texture haven't I explored?
4. How does this connect to MAMS vocabulary?

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Freedom requires structure** — Use the arc
2. **M7 is your guide** — Textural Ghost motif
3. **Extended techniques welcome** — Explore
4. **Dynamic swells essential** — Volume as music
5. **Silence is part of the composition**
