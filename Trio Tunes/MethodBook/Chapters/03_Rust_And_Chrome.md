# CHAPTER 3: RUST & CHROME

**Style:** Scofield Funk | **Key:** E Major | **Tempo:** 95 BPM | **Time:** 4/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Gritty, angular lines with open string drones."*

Rust & Chrome channels John Scofield's funky, blues-inflected style. The key of E allows for extensive use of open strings as drones, creating a gritty, resonant texture. The slower tempo (95 BPM) gives room for rhythmic push-and-pull.

**Playing Tip:** Dig in with the right hand; use legato slides for the left.

## THE FORM

16-bar vamp-based form:

```
| E7#9    | E7#9    | A7      | A7      |
| E7#9    | E7#9    | B7#9    | A7      |
| E7#9    | E7#9    | F#7     | A7 B7   |
| E7#9    | E7#9    | E7#9    | E7#9    |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Dominant 7#9 (Hendrix chord)**: The characteristic Scofield funk sound
2. **Open E pedal**: The low E string drones throughout
3. **Blues form variant**: Based on blues but with extended vamp sections
4. **Chromatic approach**: F#7 in bar 11 creates tension before resolution

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Alternate |
|:---|:---|:---|
| E7#9 | E Blues | E Mixolydian b6 |
| A7 | A Mixolydian | A Blues |
| B7#9 | B Blues | B Phrygian Dominant |
| F#7 | F# Mixolydian | F# Lydian Dominant |

### The Scofield Sound

Scofield often combines:
- **Blues scale** for the core vocabulary
- **Chromatic approach notes** for tension
- **Mixolydian** for cleaner passages
- **Minor pentatonic a half-step up** for "outside" moments

Over E7#9, try E minor pentatonic AND F minor pentatonic.

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| E7#9 | E Major | D Major | Creates 7, 9, #11 |
| E7#9 | G Minor | D Major | Blues minor-over-major |
| A7 | A Major | G Major | Mixolydian color |
| B7#9 | D Minor | B Major | Dark, angular |

### The "Blues Triad" Trick

Over E7#9, alternate between:
- **E Major triad** (E-G#-B) = the "bright" side
- **G Minor triad** (G-Bb-D) = the "dark" side (b3, b5, b7)

This major/minor ambiguity is the heart of blues.

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Lyrical Blues (Version A)

**Concept:** Singing, BB King-style phrases with Scofield edge

- Start phrases behind the beat
- Use bends and slides liberally
- Target the #9 (G natural) as a key tension note
- Leave space—let the E7 ring

**Phrase Structure:** Call (2 bars) → Response (2 bars) → Rest (1 bar)

### Chorus 2: Angular Funk (Version B)

**Concept:** Jagged, syncopated lines with triad pair angularity

- Heavy use of 16th-note syncopation
- Unpredictable accents
- Wide intervals (7ths, 9ths)
- Open strings as pedal points

**Rhythmic Pattern:**
```
| 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a |
| X . X . . X . X . . X . X . . X |
```

### Chorus 3: Drone Counterpoint (Version C)

**Concept:** Two voices—melody over sustained open string drone

**Texture:**
- **Bottom**: Open E string (continuous drone)
- **Top**: Melodic line on strings 1-3

The drone creates a "tanpura" effect, grounding the harmony while the melody floats above.

## VOICING REFERENCE

### The Hendrix Chord (E7#9)
```
E7#9:   0-7-6-7-8-x (open low E)
        x-7-6-7-8-x (no open string)
        0-7-6-7-5-x (with D on top)
```

### Funk Voicings
```
A7:     5-x-5-6-5-x (shell)
B7#9:   7-x-7-8-9-x 
F#7:    2-x-2-3-2-x
```

### Drone Voicings
```
E7 drone:  0-x-x-9-8-7 (melody in harmonics)
           0-x-x-4-5-4 (melody lower)
```

---

## TECHNIQUE FOCUS: LEGATO SLIDES

Scofield's lines often use **hammer-ons, pull-offs, and slides** to create a slippery, vocal quality.

### Slide Exercise
```
e|--7-/9--7-\5--7-/9-|
B|-------------------|
```
Keep the slide smooth—no audible fret clicks.

### Hammer-Pull Cells
```
e|--7-h-9-p-7--5-h-7-p-5--|
```
Practice these over the E7#9 vamp.

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: The Groove
- [ ] Loop E7#9 and practice sitting in the pocket
- [ ] Work on playing behind the beat
- [ ] Practice bends: half-step, whole-step, 1.5 steps

### Week 2: Angular Lines
- [ ] Drill the E/D triad pair
- [ ] Practice G minor over E7 (the "dark" sound)
- [ ] Work on syncopated rhythmic patterns

### Week 3: Drone Technique
- [ ] Practice muting unwanted strings while droning E
- [ ] Develop independence: melody moves, drone sustains
- [ ] Work on Version C slowly

### Week 4: Scofield Vibe
- [ ] Combine all elements
- [ ] Play with a funk drum loop
- [ ] Record and analyze your time feel

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **John Scofield** — *A Go Go* (the funk blueprint)
2. **John Scofield** — *Uberjam* (more groove)
3. **John Scofield** — *Pick Hits Live* (raw energy)
4. **Medeski Martin & Wood** — *Uninvisible* (similar vibe)

---

## TONE TIPS

For the authentic Scofield sound:
- **Guitar**: Semi-hollow (ES-335, Ibanez AS200)
- **Amp**: Overdriven tube amp (just breaking up)
- **No effects**: Or minimal—slight compression, touch of reverb
- **Attack**: Dig in with the pick for grit

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Too clean**: This tune needs grit—don't sanitize it
2. **Ignoring the drone**: The open E is a feature, not a bug
3. **Rushing 16ths**: Stay in the pocket, especially on syncopation
4. **Over-bending**: Bends should be in tune, not random

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Does my E7#9 have the right amount of grit?
- [ ] Can I hear the minor/major blues ambiguity?
- [ ] Am I sitting behind the beat naturally?
- [ ] Does my drone counterpoint have independence?
