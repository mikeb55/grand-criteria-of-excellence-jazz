# CHAPTER 14: SOLAR FLARE

**Style:** Fusion/Original | **Key:** C# Major | **Tempo:** 150 BPM | **Time:** 7/8

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Rapid-fire triad pairs in a 7/8 ostinato."*

Solar Flare combines the rhythmic complexity of 7/8 with the melodic intensity of rapid triad pair movement. The key of C# (enharmonic Db) is unusual for guitar but creates a bright, cutting sound perfect for fusion.

**Playing Tip:** Accent the first beat of each grouping (4+3 or 3+4).

---

## THE FORM

16-bar form in 7/8:

```
| C#maj7   | D#m7     | Emaj7    | F#7      |
| C#maj7   | A#m7     | Bmaj7    | G#7sus4  |
| Amaj7    | Bmaj7    | C#maj7   | D#7      |
| G#m7     | C#7      | F#maj7   | G#7sus4  |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **7/8 meter**: Grouped as 4+3 or 3+4
2. **Rapid triad pairs**: Constant eighth-note movement
3. **Modal mixture**: Borrowing from parallel minor
4. **Fusion vocabulary**: Pentatonics, altered dominants

---

## UNDERSTANDING 7/8

### The Two Groupings

**4+3 (ONE-two-three-four-FIVE-six-seven):**
```
| X . . . X . . |
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

**3+4 (ONE-two-three-FOUR-five-six-seven):**
```
| X . . X . . . |
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

Solar Flare primarily uses **4+3**, with occasional **3+4** for phrase variation.

### Physical Practice

Before playing:
1. Count: ONE-two-three-four-FIVE-six-seven (accent 1 and 5)
2. Clap on 1 and 5
3. Walk: four steps, three steps, four steps, three steps
4. Feel it before you play it

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Fusion Color |
|:---|:---|:---|
| C#maj7 | C# Lydian | #11 = F## (G natural) |
| D#m7 | D# Dorian | Natural 6 = B# (C natural) |
| F#7 | F# Mixolydian | Lydian Dominant for #11 |
| Amaj7 | A Lydian | Borrowed from C# minor |
| G#7sus4 | G# Mixolydian | Sus4 tension |

### Fusion Pentatonics

Over C#maj7, use:
- **C# major pentatonic**: C#-D#-E#-G#-A#
- **D# minor pentatonic**: D#-F#-G#-A#-C# (II minor = Lydian sound)
- **G# minor pentatonic**: G#-B-C#-D#-F# (V minor = modal sound)

---

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Fusion Sound |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| C#maj7 | C# Major | D# Major | Lydian (9, #11, 6) |
| D#m7 | D# Minor | F# Major | Dorian color |
| F#7 | F# Major | E Major | Mixolydian |
| Amaj7 | A Major | B Major | Lydian |

### The 7/8 Triad Pattern

Fit triad pairs into 7/8:
```
| C#-E#-G# D#-F##-A# | (4 + 3 = 7)
     (4)       (3)
```

Or:
```
| C#-E#-G# D#-F## | A#-C#-E# | (3 + 4 = 7)
     (3)    (2)      (2)
```

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Lyrical 7/8 (Version A)

**Concept:** Singing melody that breathes with the 7/8

- Emphasize the natural phrase lengths (7, 14, 21, 28 beats)
- Use the 4+3 grouping for forward momentum
- Phrase endings often on beat 5 or 7
- Let the meter become natural

**Phrase Lengths:**
| Bars | Beats | Feel |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | 7 | Short fragment |
| 2 | 14 | Standard phrase |
| 4 | 28 | Extended phrase |

### Chorus 2: Rapid Triad Pairs (Version B)

**Concept:** Continuous eighth notes using triad pairs

- 7 eighth notes per bar = 3+4 or 4+3 triads
- Constant movement, no rests
- Accent chord changes only
- Creates "solar flare" intensity

**Pattern Example (C#maj7):**
```
| C#-E#-G# A#-D#-F## A# | (4+3 grouping)
```

### Chorus 3: Polymetric Counterpoint (Version C)

**Concept:** One voice in 7/8, another implying 4/4

**Texture:**
- **Top voice**: Clear 7/8 melody
- **Bottom voice**: 4-note pattern (implies 4/4)

The polyrhythm resolves every 28 beats (4 bars of 7/8 = 7 bars of 4/4).

## VOICING REFERENCE

### C# Major Key Voicings
```
C#maj7:   x-4-3-5-6-x (root position)
D#m7:     x-6-6-6-7-6
Emaj7:    x-7-6-8-9-x
F#7:      2-x-2-3-2-x (barre)
A#m7:     x-1-3-1-2-x
Bmaj7:    x-2-1-3-4-x
```

### Fusion Voicings (quartal)
```
C#maj7:   x-4-6-6-6-x (stacked 4ths)
G#7sus4:  x-x-6-8-7-9 (sus4 stack)
```

## TECHNIQUE: 7/8 AT 150 BPM

### Speed + Odd Meter

At 150 BPM in 7/8:
- Each beat = 400ms
- Each bar = 2.8 seconds
- Eighth note = 200ms

This is fast, but the 7/8 creates natural breathing points.

### Practice Strategy

1. **Start at 60 BPM**: Learn the material slowly
2. **Group in 4+3**: Feel the subdivisions clearly
3. **Use metronome on 1 and 5**: Accent the groupings
4. **Gradually increase**: 10 BPM at a time
5. **Target 150**: But don't sacrifice clarity for speed

### Relaxation

At high tempos in odd meter:
- Breathe with the 7/8 (inhale on 1-4, exhale on 5-7)
- Minimize motion
- Let the pattern carry you
- Trust muscle memory

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: The Meter
- [ ] Internalize 7/8 through counting/clapping
- [ ] Practice quarter notes through the changes
- [ ] Feel 4+3 and 3+4 groupings

### Week 2: Triad Pairs
- [ ] Master C#/D# major triad pair
- [ ] Apply to 7/8 rhythm
- [ ] Work on Version B slowly (80 BPM)

### Week 3: Speed Building
- [ ] Increase tempo by 10 BPM daily
- [ ] Maintain clean articulation
- [ ] Target 120 BPM by end of week

### Week 4: Performance Tempo
- [ ] Push to 150 BPM
- [ ] Work on polymetric counterpoint
- [ ] Integrate all three choruses

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Allan Holdsworth** — *Metal Fatigue* (fusion, odd meters)
2. **Mahavishnu Orchestra** — *Inner Mounting Flame* (fusion classic)
3. **Return to Forever** — *Romantic Warrior* (fusion)
4. **Tigran Hamasyan** — *An Ancient Observer* (modern fusion)
5. **Animals as Leaders** — *The Joy of Motion* (modern guitar)

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Losing the 7**: The brain wants 8—fight it
2. **Rushing beat 7**: The final beat needs full value
3. **Too many accents**: Accent 1 and 5, let others flow
4. **Tension at speed**: Relaxation enables speed
5. **Ignoring groupings**: 4+3 ≠ 3+4—know which you're using

---

## THE "SOLAR FLARE" CONCEPT

The title evokes:
- **Solar**: Bright, intense, C# major brilliance
- **Flare**: Sudden burst of energy, rapid triad pairs
- **Cosmic**: The 7/8 feel is otherworldly

Imagine a sun in explosion—intense, brilliant, rhythmically complex. Your playing should have that energy.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Can I feel 7/8 without counting?
- [ ] Are my triad pairs clean at tempo?
- [ ] Is my 4+3 grouping clear?
- [ ] Does the polymetric counterpoint create tension?
- [ ] Does it have "solar flare" intensity?
