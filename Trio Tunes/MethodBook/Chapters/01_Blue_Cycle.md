# CHAPTER 1: BLUE CYCLE

**Style:** Blues (Cycle) | **Key:** Bb Major | **Tempo:** 120 BPM | **Time:** 4/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Wyble counterpoint meets Coltrane changes."*

Blue Cycle is your entry point into the Trio Tunes collection. It's built on the most fundamental form in jazz—the 12-bar blues—but with a twist: we're incorporating cycle-of-fourths movements and two-voice counterpoint inspired by Jimmy Wyble.

**Playing Tip:** Focus on hand separation; keep the bass line independent from the melody.

## THE FORM

The 12-bar blues in Bb, with modern substitutions:

```
| Bb7    | Eb7    | Bb7    | Fm7 Bb7 |
| Eb7    | Edim7  | Bb7    | G7alt   |
| Cm7    | F7alt  | Bb7 G7 | Cm7 F7  |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Bar 6 (Edim7)**: Barry Harris-style connector between IV and I
2. **Bar 8 (G7alt)**: Tritone substitution creates forward motion
3. **Bars 9-12**: Classic ii-V turnaround with alterations

---

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | Alternate |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Bb7 | Bb Mixolydian | Bb Lydian Dominant |
| Eb7 | Eb Mixolydian | Eb Lydian Dominant |
| Edim7 | E Whole-Half Diminished | — |
| G7alt | G Altered (Super Locrian) | G Half-Whole Dim |
| F7alt | F Altered | F Half-Whole Dim |

### Barry Harris Logic

On the **Fm7-Bb7** in bar 4, use the **Ab Major 6 Diminished Scale**:
- Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - E - F - G

This single scale smoothly outlines the entire ii-V.

---

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Sound |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Bb7 | Bb Major | Ab Major | Mixolydian (b7, 9, 11) |
| G7alt | G Augmented | Db Major | Tritone tension |
| F7alt | A Diminished | Eb Minor | 7b9 + altered color |

### Exercise: Triad Pair Cells

Practice this pattern over Bb7:
```
Bb-D-F (up) → Ab-C-Eb (down) → Bb-D-F (up)...
```

Then apply rhythmic variations:
- Straight eighths
- Swing eighths
- Triplet groupings
- Displaced accents

---

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Lyrical (Version A)

**Concept:** Call and response between registers

- **Bars 1-4**: "Question" phrase using motif F-D-C-Bb
- **Bars 5-8**: "Answer" flattening the 3rd (F-Db-C-Bb)
- **Bars 9-12**: Rhythmic displacement over the turnaround

**Practice Focus:** Sing each phrase before playing it. The melody should breathe naturally.

### Chorus 2: Modern Triad Pairs (Version B)

**Concept:** Continuous eighth notes, angular lines

- **Bar 1**: Bb triad descending, Ab triad ascending
- **Bar 4 (ii-V)**: Ab Major → E Diminished for Bb7b9 tension
- **Bar 8**: G Augmented arpeggio into Db Major arpeggio

**Practice Focus:** Keep the time steady. The lines should flow despite the angularity.

### Chorus 3: Wyble Counterpoint (Version C)

**Concept:** Independent bass against melody

**Texture Map:**
| Voice | Rhythm | Range |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Top | Dotted quarters, sustained | Strings 1-2 |
| Bottom | Walking quarters or 8ths | Strings 4-6 |

**Key Moment (Bar 6 - Edim7):**
- Top voice: Hold high Bb
- Bottom voice: Chromatic walk E-G-G#-A

**Ending:** Contrary motion expansion into Bb13 chord

## VOICING REFERENCE

### Shell Voicings
```
Bb7:    6-x-6-7-x-x (Root position)
        x-5-6-5-6-x (Eb9/Bb - 2nd inversion flavor)

G7alt:  3-x-3-4-4-x (G7#5)
        x-4-3-4-4-x (Db9 - tritone sub voicing)

F7alt:  1-x-1-2-4-x (F7#9)
```

### Counterpoint Voicings
For the Wyble sections, use these "split" voicings:
```
Bb7 split: 6-x-x-x-6-x (Root + 5th, wide)
Eb7 split: x-6-x-x-8-x (Root + 5th)
```

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Learn the melody (Version A) by heart
- [ ] Practice chord voicings through the form
- [ ] Memorize the scale palette

### Week 2: Triad Pairs
- [ ] Drill Bb/Ab triad pair over Bb7
- [ ] Apply to the full blues form
- [ ] Work on Version B at slow tempo (60 BPM)

### Week 3: Counterpoint
- [ ] Isolate bass line only
- [ ] Isolate melody only
- [ ] Combine at very slow tempo (50 BPM)
- [ ] Gradually increase to 120 BPM

### Week 4: Integration
- [ ] Play all three choruses consecutively
- [ ] Record yourself and analyze
- [ ] Work on the Version D hybrid

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

To internalize this style, listen to:

1. **John Coltrane** — *Blue Train* (cycle movement inspiration)
2. **Jimmy Wyble** — *The Jimmy Wyble Etudes* (counterpoint concepts)
3. **Barry Harris** — Any live recording (6th diminished concepts)
4. **Pat Martino** — *El Hombre* (blues with modern harmony)

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Rushing the turnaround**: Bars 9-12 often speed up. Use a metronome.
2. **Losing the bass independence**: The bottom voice should be singable alone.
3. **Overplaying altered tensions**: On G7alt and F7alt, let the alterations speak—don't stack them.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION CHECKLIST

After learning this tune, ask yourself:

- [ ] Can I sing the melody without the guitar?
- [ ] Can I sing the bass line independently?
- [ ] Can I hear the triad pairs resolving?
- [ ] Does my counterpoint have clear voice separation?
- [ ] Does the whole thing *swing*?
