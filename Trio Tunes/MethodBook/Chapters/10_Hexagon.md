# CHAPTER 10: HEXAGON

**Style:** Odd Meter (5/4) | **Key:** B Major | **Tempo:** 135 BPM | **Time:** 5/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"A 5/4 groove built on hexatonic scales."*

Hexagon combines two challenging elements: the asymmetric 5/4 meter and the six-note hexatonic scales. The key of B provides a bright, cutting sound, and the tempo pushes you to internalize the odd meter.

**Playing Tip:** Count "1-2-3, 1-2" internally until it becomes natural.

---

## THE FORM

16-bar form in 5/4:

```
| Bmaj7#11  | F#7sus4   | Emaj7     | C#m9      |
| Bmaj7#11  | Abm7b5    | G#m7      | F#sus4    |
| Amaj7     | Emaj7     | Bmaj7     | F#7       |
| D#m7      | G#7alt    | C#m7      | F#7sus4   |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **5/4 meter**: Grouped as 3+2 or 2+3
2. **Hexatonic scales**: Six-note scales combining two triads
3. **Lydian dominance**: Most major chords use Lydian (#11)
4. **Suspended tensions**: F#7sus4 creates ambiguity

---

## UNDERSTANDING 5/4

### The Two Groupings

**3+2 (ONE-two-three-FOUR-five):**
```
| X . . X . |
  1 2 3 4 5
```

**2+3 (ONE-two-THREE-four-five):**
```
| X . X . . |
  1 2 3 4 5
```

Hexagon primarily uses **3+2**, but switches to **2+3** at phrase endings.

### Physical Practice

Before playing:
1. Walk in 5/4 (step on 1 and 4)
2. Clap on 1 and 4 while counting
3. Add a foot tap on every beat
4. Feel it in your body first

## HEXATONIC SCALES

### What Is a Hexatonic Scale?

A **hexatonic scale** has six notes, typically formed by combining two triads:

| Scale | Triads | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| B Major Hexatonic | B + C# | B-C#-D#-E#-F#-G# |
| B Minor Hexatonic | B + C#m | B-C#-D-E-F#-G# |
| B Augmented Hex | B+ + C+ | B-C-D#-E-G-G# |

### Why Hexatonic?

- **Six notes** fit naturally into 3+2 groupings
- Creates **modern, angular** sound
- Avoids the "scalar" quality of 7-note scales
- Strong **triad pair** connection

---

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | Hexatonic |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Bmaj7#11 | B Major | C# Major | B-C#-D#-E#-F#-G# |
| F#7sus4 | F# Major | E Major | E-F#-G#-A#-B-C# |
| Emaj7 | E Major | F# Major | E-F#-G#-A#-B-C# |
| G#m7 | G# Minor | B Major | G#-A#-B-C#-D#-F# |

### The "Hexagon Pattern"

Over Bmaj7#11, play:
```
B-D#-F# (B major) - C#-E#-G# (C# major) = 6 notes
```

Group in 3+2:
```
| B-D#-F# | C#-E# | (rest) |
```

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Melodic 5/4 (Version A)

**Concept:** Lyrical melody that breathes with the 5/4

- Phrases naturally end on beat 4 or 5
- Use the 3+2 grouping for forward motion
- Use 2+3 for phrase endings (more conclusive)
- Let the meter become the melody's shape

**Phrase Lengths:**
| Bars | Beats | Feel |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 bar | 5 | Short idea |
| 2 bars | 10 | Standard phrase |
| 4 bars | 20 | Extended phrase |

### Chorus 2: Hexatonic Lines (Version B)

**Concept:** Continuous eighth notes using hexatonic scales

- Six-note patterns fit perfectly into 3+2
- Alternate between stable and color triads
- Create rhythmic variety through accent placement

**Pattern:**
```
| B-D#-F# C#-E# | G#-C#-E# B-D# | etc.
    (3)    (2)       (3)    (2)
```

### Chorus 3: Polymetric Counterpoint (Version C)

**Concept:** One voice in 5/4, another implying 4/4

**Texture:**
- **Top voice**: Clear 5/4 melody
- **Bottom voice**: Pattern that suggests 4/4 (creates tension)

The 4-against-5 polyrhythm resolves every 20 beats (4 bars of 5/4).

## VOICING REFERENCE

### Suspended Voicings
```
Bmaj7#11:  x-2-1-3-4-x
F#7sus4:   x-9-9-9-9-x (barre)
           2-x-2-4-2-x (open shape)
F#sus4:    2-x-4-4-2-x
```

### Hexatonic Voicings (stacked triads)
```
B/C#:      x-4-4-4-4-x (B triad + C# bass)
E/F#:      x-9-9-9-9-x (E triad + F# bass)
```

---

## TECHNIQUE: ODD METER INTERNALIZATION

### The "Word Method"

Assign words to the meter:

**3+2:**
```
| ELE-phant | ZE-bra |
  1  2  3     4  5
```

**2+3:**
```
| TI-ger | AL-li-GA |
  1  2    3  4  5
```

### The "Conducting Method"

Conduct the meter with your fretting hand:
- Beat 1: Down
- Beat 2: Right
- Beat 3: Up (completing first group)
- Beat 4: Left
- Beat 5: Center (completing second group)

### Practice with Recordings

Listen to music in 5/4:
- Dave Brubeck — "Take Five" (the classic)
- Radiohead — "15 Step" (rock version)
- Sting — "Seven Days" (pop version)

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: The Meter
- [ ] Practice counting and clapping 5/4
- [ ] Walk in 5/4 (step on 1 and 4)
- [ ] Play simple quarter notes through the changes

### Week 2: Hexatonic
- [ ] Master B hexatonic scale (B + C# triads)
- [ ] Apply to Bmaj7#11 bars
- [ ] Extend to all chords in the form

### Week 3: Phrasing
- [ ] Work on Version A melody
- [ ] Practice phrases that end on beat 4 and 5
- [ ] Develop natural breathing in 5/4

### Week 4: Polymetric
- [ ] Practice 4-against-5 polyrhythm
- [ ] Develop Version C counterpoint
- [ ] Integrate all three choruses

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Dave Brubeck Quartet** — *Time Out* ("Take Five")
2. **Radiohead** — *In Rainbows* ("15 Step")
3. **Pat Metheny Group** — *The Way Up* (complex meters)
4. **Tigran Hamasyan** — *Mockroot* (Armenian jazz in odd meters)
5. **Avishai Cohen** — *Gently Disturbed* (odd meter jazz)

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Counting in 4**: The brain wants 4/4—resist it
2. **Rushing beat 5**: The final beat often gets short-changed
3. **Ignoring groupings**: 3+2 and 2+3 feel different—use both
4. **Too many notes**: In odd meter, less is clearer
5. **Losing the pulse**: The groove must be solid even in 5/4

---

## THE "HEXAGON" CONCEPT

The title has multiple meanings:
- **Hex (six)**: The hexatonic (6-note) scales
- **Hexagon shape**: Six-sided, like the 3+2 and 2+3 groupings
- **A-gon (contest)**: The challenge of odd meter

The hexagon is a stable shape in nature (honeycombs). Similarly, 5/4 becomes stable once internalized.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Can I feel 5/4 without counting?
- [ ] Do my phrases breathe naturally in the meter?
- [ ] Can I play hexatonic lines fluently?
- [ ] Does the polymetric counterpoint create tension and release?
- [ ] Is my time feel solid (not rushing beat 5)?
