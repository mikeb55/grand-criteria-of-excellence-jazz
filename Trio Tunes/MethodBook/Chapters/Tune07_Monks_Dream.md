# THE CONCEPT

Monk's Dream explores Thelonious Monk's angular world:
- **Whole-tone harmony:** C whole-tone scale basis
- **Rhythmic displacement:** Notes fall in unexpected places
- **Space as composition:** Silence between stabs
- **Geometric intervals:** Architectural, angular

# CHORD PROGRESSION

```
A: | CMaj7#5  | CMaj7#5  | D7#11    | D7#11    |
   | E7#9     | E7#9     | F#7#11   | G#7alt   |
   
B: | AbMaj7   | BbMaj7   | BMaj7    | C+       |

A: (return)
```

### Harmonic Analysis
- **Whole-tone root movement:** C→D→E→F#→G# (all whole steps)
- **Augmented quality:** #5 and + chords throughout
- **B section: Chromatic descent**

# MOTIF USAGE

| Motif | Usage |
|:------|:------|
| **M3** | Angular cells |
| **M7** | Space and stabs |
| **Monk DNA** | Rhythmic displacement |

### Dominant DNA
- **Whole-tone intervals:** Augmented quality
- **R-3 (Displacement):** 50% — Monk's signature
- **R-6 (Space):** 40% — Silence as sound

# EXPERIMENTAL ELEMENTS

### Whole-Tone Scale
```
C - D - E - F# - G# - A# - C
```
All intervals are whole steps. Creates floating, unresolved quality.

### Monk Rhythmic Displacement
```
Normal:  | 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . |
Monk:    | . 1 . . 2 . . 3 |
```
Notes arrive "late" and in unexpected places.

# KEY PHRASES

### 1. Whole-Tone Run
```
| C    D    E    F#   G#   A#   |
```

### 2. Monk Stab
```
| rest rest C-E  rest | rest G#  rest rest |
  (displaced accents)
```

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Whole-tone creates floating quality**
2. **Displacement is Monk's signature**
3. **Space is as important as notes**
4. **Geometric, architectural thinking**
5. **Don't rush the silence**
