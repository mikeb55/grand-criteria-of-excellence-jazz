# CHAPTER 11: CRYSTAL SILENCE

**Style:** ECM Ballad | **Key:** A Major | **Tempo:** 80 BPM | **Time:** 4/4

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Open string voicings high up the neck."*

Crystal Silence captures the spacious, reverberant aesthetic of the ECM record label. The key of A allows rich open-string voicings, and the "campanella" technique creates a harp-like, ringing texture where notes sustain into each other.

**Playing Tip:** Let strings ring into each other (campanella). Less is more.

---

## THE FORM

16-bar ballad form:

```
| Amaj9     | F#m11     | Dmaj9     | E/A       |
| Amaj9     | C#m7      | Bm9       | Esus4  E7 |
| Fmaj7     | Gmaj7     | Amaj9     | Dmaj7     |
| Bm11      | E7sus4    | Amaj9     | Amaj9     |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Open strings**: A, E, B, D, G all used as pedals
2. **11th chords**: F#m11, Bm11 create suspension
3. **Modal interchange**: Fmaj7 (borrowed from A minor)
4. **Campanella**: Notes ring together like bells

## SCALE PALETTE

| Chord | Primary Scale | ECM Color |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Amaj9 | A Lydian | Open, floating |
| F#m11 | F# Aeolian | Suspended, melancholy |
| Dmaj9 | D Lydian | Bright neighbor |
| Bm9 | B Dorian | Natural 6 (G#) |
| Fmaj7 | F Lydian | Borrowed from minor |
| Gmaj7 | G Lydian | Chromatic approach to A |

### The ECM Sound

ECM (Edition of Contemporary Music) recordings feature:
- **Space and reverb** as compositional elements
- **Quiet dynamics** (the loudest is mezzo-forte)
- **Open voicings** with wide intervals
- **Melodic simplicity** over harmonic sophistication

---

## CAMPANELLA TECHNIQUE

### What Is Campanella?

"Campanella" (Italian for "little bell") is a technique where **notes ring into each other**, creating overlapping sustain.

**Normal playing:**
```
Note 1: |====|
Note 2:      |====|
Note 3:           |====|
```

**Campanella:**
```
Note 1: |==========|
Note 2:    |===========|
Note 3:       |============|
```

### How to Achieve It

1. **Don't dampen strings** after picking
2. **Use different strings** for adjacent notes
3. **Let open strings ring** whenever possible
4. **Use the "harp" fingering** (no repeated strings)

### Example (A major scale, campanella):
```
e|----------0--2--|
B|-------2--------|
G|----2-----------|
D|-2--------------|
A|0---------------|
E|----------------|
```

Each note is on a different string, so they all ring together.

## TRIAD PAIR VOCABULARY

| Chord | Stable | Color | ECM Sound |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Amaj9 | A Major | B Major | Lydian, open |
| F#m11 | F# Minor | A Major | Suspended |
| Dmaj9 | D Major | E Major | Lydian |
| Bm9 | D Major | E Major | Relative major |

### Open-String Triad Pairs

Over Amaj9, use triads with open strings:
```
A Major: A(open)-C#(string 2)-E(open)
E Major: E(open)-G#(string 1)-B(open)
```

## THE THREE CHORUSES

### Chorus 1: Lyrical Sustain (Version A)

**Concept:** Long, breathing phrases with maximum sustain

- Whole notes and half notes predominantly
- Target notes should ring for their full value
- Use open strings as much as possible
- Dynamics: pp to mp maximum

**Phrase Shape:**
```
Bars 1-4: Ascending arch (building)
Bars 5-8: Descending release
Bars 9-12: Distant excursion (Fmaj7, Gmaj7)
Bars 13-16: Return and fade
```

### Chorus 2: Campanella Arpeggios (Version B)

**Concept:** Arpeggiated lines using different strings for each note

- No repeated strings within a phrase
- Notes overlap and sustain
- Creates "harp" or "piano" effect
- Speed: moderate—focus on sustain, not velocity

**Example Pattern (Amaj9):**
```
e|------------0---------|
B|--------2-------------|
G|----2-----------------|
D|--2-------------------|
A|0---------------------|
E|----------------------|
```

### Chorus 3: High Position + Open Strings (Version C)

**Concept:** Melody in high positions with open string drones

**Texture:**
- **Drone**: Open A or E string sustained throughout
- **Melody**: Frets 9-14 on strings 1-2

This creates a "sitar" effect—high melody over low drone.

## VOICING REFERENCE

### Open String Voicings
```
Amaj9:   x-0-6-6-0-0 (open E, A ring)
F#m11:   x-0-4-6-0-0 (A pedal)
Dmaj9:   x-5-4-6-5-0 (high E rings)
E/A:     x-0-2-1-0-0 (E over A bass)
Bm11:    x-2-4-2-0-0 (open E)
```

### High Position Voicings
```
Amaj9:   x-12-11-13-12-0 (open high E)
Dmaj7:   x-x-11-11-10-0 (high position with open E)
```

### Campanella Chord Shapes
```
Amaj7:   x-0-x-6-5-4 (notes on different strings)
Fmaj7:   x-x-3-5-5-0 (open high E adds 7th)
```

## PRACTICE ROUTINE

### Week 1: Sustain
- [ ] Practice not dampening strings
- [ ] Work on smooth, slow right-hand technique
- [ ] Focus on clean, ringing tone

### Week 2: Campanella
- [ ] Learn the A major scale in campanella fingering
- [ ] Practice arpeggios using different strings
- [ ] Work on Version B

### Week 3: High Position
- [ ] Explore melody in positions 9-14
- [ ] Add open string drones
- [ ] Develop Version C

### Week 4: Integration
- [ ] Play all three choruses
- [ ] Record with reverb and evaluate
- [ ] Focus on dynamics (never louder than mp)

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Ralph Towner** — *Solstice* (ECM guitar)
2. **Bill Frisell** — *Good Dog, Happy Man* (open voicings)
3. **Egberto Gismonti** — *Sol Do Meio Dia* (Brazilian ECM)
4. **Pat Metheny** — *One Quiet Night* (spacious solo guitar)
5. **Keith Jarrett** — *The Köln Concert* (piano, but essential ECM)

---

## TONE TIPS

For the ECM sound:
- **Guitar**: Nylon or steel-string acoustic (or clean electric)
- **Reverb**: Long, lush hall reverb (essential)
- **EQ**: Warm, not bright—roll off highs
- **Dynamics**: Play softly; let the reverb do the work
- **Room**: If acoustic, play in a resonant space

---

## COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Dampening strings**: Let them ring—this is the whole point
2. **Playing too loud**: ECM is about quiet, intimate sound
3. **Too many notes**: Space and sustain are the music
4. **Ignoring open strings**: They're your best friends here
5. **Rushing**: At 80 BPM, slow down even more internally

---

## THE "CRYSTAL SILENCE" CONCEPT

The title evokes:
- **Crystal**: Clarity, purity, transparent sound
- **Silence**: The reverb tail, the space between notes
- **ECM aesthetic**: Music as atmosphere, not entertainment

Imagine you're in a stone cathedral, alone, at twilight. The sound decays slowly into the space. Each note is an event.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION

- [ ] Are my strings ringing into each other?
- [ ] Am I using open strings effectively?
- [ ] Are my dynamics soft enough?
- [ ] Does the high-position melody sing over the drone?
- [ ] Is there enough space and reverb?
