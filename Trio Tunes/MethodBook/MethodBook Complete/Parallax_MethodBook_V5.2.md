# HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for guitarists who want to develop genuine harmonic understanding on the instrument. You should be comfortable reading chord charts, playing basic jazz voicings, and navigating common progressions. You don't need to be advanced—but you do need to be serious.

If you're looking for shortcuts or licks to memorize, this isn't the right resource. If you want to understand why certain voicings work, how harmony actually moves, and how to develop real control over your sound, keep reading.

## The Three-Level System

This method is organized around three progressive levels. Each level builds on the previous one.

**Level 1: Harmonic Vocabulary**

This is where you learn *what* the chords are. Each tune presents a complete harmonic landscape—chord symbols, scale choices, voicing options. The goal is to know the material intellectually and to have multiple ways to voice each chord.

Level 1 establishes the vocabulary. Without it, the higher levels have nothing to build on.

**Level 2: Physical Clarity & Shell Voicings**

This is where you learn *where* the chords live on the instrument. The Level 2 Shell Voicing Maps reduce each chord to its functional essence: root, third, and seventh, all within a single position on the neck (7th position, frets 5-9).

Level 2 establishes muscle memory and visual pattern recognition. You learn to see the harmony physically, not just conceptually.

**Level 3: Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading**

This is where you learn *how* the chords connect. Level 3 is conceptual—no new notation, no new voicings. Instead, you work with the materials from Levels 1 and 2 to understand harmonic gravity, voice-leading intent, and structural awareness.

Level 3 establishes musical direction. You move from playing *at* chords to playing *through* them.

## How Recordings, Lead Sheets, and Shell Maps Relate

The materials in this method are designed to work together:

- **Lead sheets** give you the full picture—melody, harmony, form
- **Shell voicing maps** give you the functional skeleton
- **Recordings** give you the sound and feel you're aiming for

Use the lead sheets for learning the tune. Use the shell maps for internalizing the harmony physically. Use the recordings to check your work against the intended sound.

## Pacing and Revisiting

Don't rush through the levels. Most students want to skip ahead. Resist this.

Spend real time with Level 1 before moving to Level 2. Make sure your shell voicings are automatic before attempting Level 3 thinking. And expect to return to earlier levels regularly—each revisit deepens your understanding.

A realistic timeline for one tune:
- Level 1: 2-4 weeks
- Level 2: 1-2 weeks
- Level 3: ongoing (this is where musicianship develops)

## A Note on Level 3

Level 3 contains no new notation. This is intentional.

The goal of Level 3 is not to give you more material to practice—it's to change how you think about the material you already have. The summaries in this section are guides for your attention, not exercises to complete.

Read them. Think about them. Then return to your Level 2 shell voicings with fresh ears.

If Level 3 feels abstract at first, that's normal. Keep working with the shell voicings, keep listening to the recordings, and the concepts will become concrete over time.

**What Each Level Gives You**

| Level | Focus | Output | Time Investment |
|:------|:------|:-------|:----------------|
| 1 | Harmonic vocabulary | You can *describe* the harmony | 2-4 weeks per tune |
| 2 | Physical clarity | You can *find* the harmony instantly | 1-2 weeks per tune |
| 3 | Harmonic navigation | You can *move through* the harmony | Ongoing |

---

**The Key Insight**

Level 1 without Level 2 is theory without physicality.
Level 2 without Level 1 is mechanics without understanding.
Level 3 without both is abstraction without substance.

All three levels work together. The goal is integration.

# PREFACE {#preface}

*"The goal isn't to play jazz—it's to speak through it."*

## Why This Book Exists

In December 2025, I found myself preparing for a series of informal sessions with musician friends across North London—guitarists, bassists, drummers, and the occasional horn player dropping by. We needed material that was genuinely playable, harmonically interesting, and suited to the guitar trio format. What we didn't need was another collection of transcriptions or standards arrangements.

So I composed these pieces myself.

Each tune in this book is an original composition written in the style of a jazz guitar master—from Jim Hall's reflective lyricism to Ant Law's rhythmic complexity. They're designed not as tributes or imitations, but as vehicles: functional pieces that let you explore specific harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic concepts while building real repertoire you can perform.

This isn't an exercise book disguised as music. These are real tunes. They have form, narrative, and emotional arc. The educational material surrounding each piece exists to help you internalize the language so thoroughly that when you play, you're not thinking about theory—you're making music with friends.

---

## The Core Philosophy

Three principles guide this method:

**1. Style as Vocabulary.** Each chapter immerses you in a specific guitarist's harmonic and melodic language. By learning to "speak" in Jim Hall's voice, then Pat Metheny's, then John Scofield's, you develop range. Over time, these voices blend into your own.

**2. Trio Thinking.** The guitar trio is a unique format. You're simultaneously the harmonic foundation, melodic voice, and textural colorist. Every tune in this book is conceived for this reality—with space for the bass to walk or lock in, the drums to breathe or push, and the guitar to lead without dominating.

**3. Performance-Ready.** Each piece is designed to be gigged. They have clear heads, logical solo sections, and satisfying endings. The goal of your practice is always the same: play these tunes with other musicians, in front of other people, as soon as you're ready.

---

## A Final Word

The best jazz I've ever played happened in living rooms and rehearsal spaces, with friends who were willing to take risks and listen hard. That's who this book is for—musicians who want to grow, who aren't afraid of complexity, but who never forget that the point is connection.

I hope these tunes serve you as well as they've served me. Learn them, adapt them, make them your own.

# INTRODUCTION {#introduction}

## Welcome

This method book presents 11 original compositions in the style of jazz guitar masters, designed for the guitar trio format (guitar, bass, drums). Each chapter provides comprehensive study material including harmonic analysis, scale palettes, triad pair vocabulary, chord voicings, and structured practice routines.

The songs are ordered by compositional interest, educational value, and performance appeal—placing the strongest material first while building a complete repertoire that spans lyrical, modern, and groove-based styles.

---

## Practice Philosophy

- Quality over quantity — 20 focused minutes beats 2 distracted hours
- Slow practice builds speed — learn it right, then speed up
- Record yourself weekly — objectivity is essential
- Play with others — trio practice is irreplaceable
- Listen deeply — study the masters referenced in each chapter

---

## The Trio Concept

These compositions are designed specifically for the guitar trio format. Unlike big-band or combo arrangements, the trio places unique demands on the guitarist:

- **Harmonic responsibility** — You're the primary harmonic voice
- **Melodic leadership** — Melody and countermelody are your domain
- **Textural variety** — Single notes, dyads, chords, and everything between
- **Interactive listening** — Space for bass and drums to contribute

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# CHAPTER 1: THE MIRROR {#chapter-1-the-mirror}

**Style**: Jim Hall Style | **Key**: Ab Major | **Tempo**: 60 BPM | **Time**: 4/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the head (melody) from memory
- [ ] Comp through the form using shell voicings
- [ ] Play one solo chorus (Version A)
- [ ] Execute the ending (fade on Ab pedal)

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 36 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 48 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 60 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If the wide voicings are hard, use shell voicings only (root-3rd-7th). Focus on the melody first; comping can be minimal.

---

## PREREQUISITES {#prerequisites}

Before tackling this chapter, you should be able to:
- Play major 7th and minor 9th chord voicings in multiple positions
- Understand Lydian mode and its application to major chords
- Execute basic volume swells (using volume knob or pedal)
- Count comfortably at slow tempos (60 BPM quarter notes)
- Read chord charts and navigate 16-bar forms

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK {#if-you-get-stuck}

- **Can't hear the Lydian sound?** → Go to Scale Palette and play each chord with its scale
- **Wide voicings feel awkward?** → Start with Voicing Reference shell shapes first
- **Volume swells aren't smooth?** → See Technique: Volume Swells section
- **Bridge feels disconnected?** → Listen to the Listening Recommendations

---

## OVERVIEW {#overview}

*"Sparse, haunting voicings with wide spreads."*

The Mirror is the emotional center of the Trio Tunes collection. At 60 BPM, every note matters. The "mirror" concept refers to the contrary motion counterpoint in Chorus 3—when one voice ascends, the other descends, creating a reflective, palindromic effect.

**Playing Tip**: Use volume swells; control the decay. Let each note breathe.

---

## THE FORM {#the-form}

16-bar AABA form:

```
A Section (Bars 1-8):
| Abmaj9    | Fm9       | Dbmaj7#11 | Ebsus Eb7 |
| Abmaj9    | Bbm9      | Gbmaj7    | Cm7  Fm7  |

B Section (Bars 9-12):
| Bmaj7#11  | Emaj7     | Bbm7      | Eb7alt    |

A' Section (Bars 13-16):
| Abmaj9    | Fm11      | Dbmaj9 Dbm| Abmaj7/Eb |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Wide voicings**: Intervals of 9ths, 10ths, and 11ths
2. **Distant relations**: Bmaj7#11 and Emaj7 in the bridge (tritone away from home)
3. **Modal interchange**: Gbmaj7 borrowed from Ab Dorian
4. **Melancholy turn**: Dbmaj9 → Dbm(maj7) in bar 15

---

## SCALE PALETTE {#scale-palette}

| Chord | Primary Scale | Emotional Quality |
|:------|:--------------|:------------------|
| Abmaj9 | Ab Lydian | Open, spacious |
| Fm9 | F Dorian | Melancholy but not dark |
| Dbmaj7#11 | Db Lydian | Floating, dreamlike |
| Gbmaj7 | Gb Lydian | Distant, introspective |
| Bmaj7#11 | B Lydian | Ethereal, otherworldly |
| Emaj7 | E Lydian | Bright but distant |
| Eb7alt | Eb Altered | Tension seeking resolution |
| Dbm(maj7) | Db Melodic Minor | The melancholy turn |

---

## VOICING REFERENCE {#voicing-reference}

### Wide Spread Voicings

```
Abmaj9:    4-x-5-5-4-3 (open G string rings)
Fm9:       x-8-8-8-9-8 (standard shape)
Dbmaj7#11: x-4-3-5-6-x (G natural in melody)
Gbmaj7:    2-x-3-3-2-x (root position)
```

### Bridge Voicings (Distant Keys)

```
Bmaj7#11:  x-2-1-3-4-x (B Lydian voicing)
Emaj7:     x-7-6-8-9-x (wide E Lydian)
Bbm7:      x-1-3-1-2-x (shell)
Eb7alt:    x-6-5-6-7-x (cluster)
```

---

## LISTENING RECOMMENDATIONS {#listening-recommendations}

1. **Jim Hall** — *Concierto* (the master of ballad guitar)
2. **Jim Hall** — *Alone Together* (duo intimacy)
3. **Bill Frisell** — *Good Dog, Happy Man* (spacious, ambient)
4. **Pat Metheny** — *One Quiet Night* (solo ballads)

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation}

- [ ] Does every note have purpose?
- [ ] Can I hear the mirror counterpoint clearly?
- [ ] Am I using volume swells effectively?
- [ ] Does the bridge feel "distant" harmonically?
- [ ] Is there enough silence?

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- [ ] Comp through the form using open-string voicings
- [ ] Play one solo chorus (Version A)
- [ ] Execute campanella arpeggios for texture

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 48 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 64 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 80 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If campanella technique is hard, focus on simple open-position triads. Let strings ring naturally.

---

## OVERVIEW {#overview-1}

*"Open string voicings high up the neck."*

Crystal Silence captures the spacious, reverberant aesthetic of the ECM record label. The key of A allows rich open-string voicings, and the "campanella" technique creates a harp-like, ringing texture where notes sustain into each other.

**Playing Tip**: Let strings ring into each other (campanella). Less is more.

---

## THE FORM {#the-form-1}

16-bar ballad form:

```
| Amaj9     | F#m11     | Dmaj9     | E/A       |
| Amaj9     | C#m7      | Bm9       | Esus4  E7 |
| Fmaj7     | Gmaj7     | Amaj9     | Dmaj7     |
| Bm11      | E7sus4    | Amaj9     | Amaj9     |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Open strings**: A, E, B, D, G all used as pedals
2. **11th chords**: F#m11, Bm11 create suspension
3. **Modal interchange**: Fmaj7 (borrowed from A minor)
4. **Campanella**: Notes ring together like bells

---

## VOICING REFERENCE {#voicing-reference-1}

### Open String Voicings

```
Amaj9:   x-0-6-6-0-0 (open E, A ring)
F#m11:   x-0-4-6-0-0 (A pedal)
Dmaj9:   x-5-4-6-5-0 (high E rings)
E/A:     x-0-2-1-0-0 (E over A bass)
Bm11:    x-2-4-2-0-0 (open E)
```

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-1}

- [ ] Are my strings ringing into each other?
- [ ] Am I using open strings effectively?
- [ ] Are my dynamics soft enough?
- [ ] Does the high-position melody sing over the drone?
- [ ] Is there enough space and reverb?

# CHAPTER 3: ORBIT {#chapter-3-orbit}

**Style**: Wayne Shorter Style | **Key**: F Major | **Tempo**: 160 BPM | **Time**: 3/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-2}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the head (melody) from memory
- [ ] Comp through the form in 3/4 time
- [ ] Play one solo chorus (Version A)
- [ ] Feel the waltz pulse naturally

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 96 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 128 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 160 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If the non-functional harmony is confusing, focus on root motion and let each chord "be home" for its bar.

---

## OVERVIEW {#overview-2}

*"Non-functional harmony over a floating pulse."*

Orbit channels the mysterious, spacious quality of Wayne Shorter's compositions. The waltz time signature (3/4) creates a lilting, orbital motion while the harmony deliberately avoids traditional V-I resolutions.

**Playing Tip**: Let the intervals ring; prioritize sustain over speed.

---

## THE FORM {#the-form-2}

16-bar form with through-composed feel:

```
| Fmaj7#11 | Ebmaj7#5 | Dbmaj7   | Bmaj7    |
| Bbm9     | Abmaj7   | Gbmaj7   | Emaj7    |
| Fmaj7#11 | Dbmaj7   | Amaj7    | Gmaj7    |
| Fmaj7#11 | Ebm9     | Dbmaj7   | Fmaj7    |
```

### Key Harmonic Features

1. **Non-functional movement**: Chords relate by interval, not by resolution
2. **Major 7th dominance**: Almost every chord is a major 7th variant
3. **Chromatic root motion**: F → Eb → Db → B (descending chromatic)
4. **Symmetry**: Bar 1 material returns in bars 9 and 13

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-2}

- [ ] Does my playing have a floating quality?
- [ ] Can I hear the major 7th chords as "home" (not needing resolution)?
- [ ] Are my phrases breathing naturally in 3/4?
- [ ] Is there enough space between ideas?

# CHAPTER 4: PARALLAX {#chapter-4-parallax}

**Style**: John Scofield Style | **Key**: Bb Dominant | **Tempo**: 108 BPM | **Time**: 4/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-3}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the head (melody) from memory
- [ ] Comp through the form with funky feel
- [ ] Play one solo chorus using chromatic approach
- [ ] Lock in with the rhythm section on the groove

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 65 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 86 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 108 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If chromatic approaches are hard, stick to chord tones on strong beats and add chromaticism gradually.

---

## OVERVIEW {#overview-3}

*"Angular chromatic lines over dominant vamp—pure Scofield DNA."*

Parallax channels John Scofield's signature sound: chromatic approach tones, blues-inflected dominant harmony, and that unmistakable funky edge. The title refers to the shifting perspective created by chromatic voice movement—like viewing an object from slightly different angles.

**Playing Tip**: Dig in with a slightly dirty tone. This tune needs attitude, not pristine clarity.

---

## THE FORM {#the-form-3}

32-bar form over dominant vamp:

```
Section 1 - Intro (Bars 1-8):
| Bb7      | Bb7      | Eb7      | F7       |
| Bb7      | Bb7      | Eb7      | Bb7      |

Section 2 - Triad Pair Solo (Bars 9-16):
| Bb7      | Bb7      | Eb7      | Bb7      |
| Gm7      | Cm7      | F7       | Bb7      |

Section 3 - Quartal Chord Melody (Bars 17-24):
| Bb7      | Bb7      | Eb7      | Gm7      |
| Em7b5    | Cm7      | F7       | Bb7      |

Section 4 - Outro (Bars 25-32):
| Bb7      | Bb7      | Eb7      | F7       |
| Bb7      | Eb7      | Gm7      | Bb7      |
```

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-3}

- [ ] Are my chromatic approaches resolving convincingly?
- [ ] Does the tune groove despite the chromaticism?
- [ ] Am I accenting the weak beats properly?
- [ ] Can I hear the blues underneath all the extensions?
- [ ] Is there attitude in my playing?

# CHAPTER 5: FIRST LIGHT {#chapter-5-first-light}

**Style**: Pat Metheny Style | **Key**: G Major | **Tempo**: 96 BPM | **Time**: 4/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-4}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the head (melody) from memory with lyrical phrasing
- [ ] Comp through the form using open-position 9th voicings
- [ ] Play one solo chorus (Version A) with arpeggiated figures
- [ ] Breathe with each phrase naturally

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 58 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 77 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 96 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If arpeggiated phrasing is hard, focus on simple triads. The Lydian sound will still come through.

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Open-sky lyricism, arpeggiated figures that shimmer."*

First Light evokes the dawn—the first warmth breaking over the horizon. Pat Metheny's signature sound lives here: cascading arpeggios, Lydian brightness, and that feeling of wide-open space.

**Playing Tip**: Breathe. Let phrases arc like a melody sung, not played.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-4}

- [ ] Are my arpeggios flowing, not choppy?
- [ ] Does the Lydian color come through clearly?
- [ ] Am I breathing with the phrases?
- [ ] Is the voice leading smooth and logical?
- [ ] Does it sound like sunrise, not like an exercise?

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# CHAPTER 6: ANGULAR MOTION {#chapter-6-angular-motion}

**Style**: Pat Martino Style | **Key**: Gb Major | **Tempo**: 200 BPM | **Time**: 4/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-5}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the head at tempo (200 BPM) with clean articulation
- [ ] Navigate the chord changes fluently
- [ ] Execute bebop lines with chromatic approach notes
- [ ] Use economy picking for efficiency

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 120 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 160 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 200 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If 200 BPM is too fast, perform at 160 BPM. Speed is built over time.

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Linear intensity, fretboard logic at speed."*

Angular Motion is a workout—but never at the expense of musicality. Pat Martino's approach emphasizes fretboard logic: patterns that lay under the fingers naturally, chromatic connections that resolve convincingly, and lines that breathe even at high velocity.

**Playing Tip**: Relaxation is the secret to speed. If you're tensing up, slow down.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-5}

- [ ] Can I play the head cleanly at tempo?
- [ ] Are my bebop lines resolving on chord tones?
- [ ] Am I relaxed at high tempo?
- [ ] Do the chromatic approaches sound intentional?
- [ ] Is there musicality despite the speed?

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# CHAPTER 7: BLUE CYCLE {#chapter-7-blue-cycle}

**Style**: Rosenwinkel/Monder Style | **Key**: Bb Major | **Tempo**: 120 BPM | **Time**: 4/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-6}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the 12-bar blues head from memory
- [ ] Comp through the form with modern substitutions
- [ ] Play one solo chorus using triad pairs
- [ ] Execute two-voice counterpoint (Version C)

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 72 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 96 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 120 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If counterpoint is hard, stick to shell voicings and single-line solos.

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Modern blues abstraction. Reharmonization without losing the form."*

Blue Cycle takes the 12-bar blues and filters it through modern harmony—Kurt Rosenwinkel's angular phrasing, Ben Monder's dense voicings. The blues is still there underneath. You just have to listen for it.

**Playing Tip**: Keep the blues feel even when the harmony gets dense.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-6}

- [ ] Can I hear the blues underneath the reharmonization?
- [ ] Are my counterpoint voices independent?
- [ ] Does the turnaround resolve convincingly?
- [ ] Am I using triad pairs melodically, not mechanically?

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# CHAPTER 8: HARMOLODIC SKETCH {#chapter-8-harmolodic-sketch}

**Style**: Bill Frisell Style | **Key**: G Major | **Tempo**: 88 BPM | **Time**: 4/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-7}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the simple folk-like melody from memory
- [ ] Comp with open triads and suspended chords
- [ ] Use volume swells for texture
- [ ] Leave plenty of space between phrases

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 53 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 70 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 88 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If open voicings are hard, use simple triads (G, C, D, Em, Am). The texture will still work.

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Textural, spacious, Americana-inflected. Open triads that ring like bells."*

Harmolodic Sketch channels Bill Frisell's unique voice: the volume swells, the ringing open strings, the folk-melody simplicity wrapped in sophisticated texture. It's American roots music filtered through an artist's sensibility.

**Playing Tip**: One note with intention beats ten notes without.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-7}

- [ ] Am I leaving enough space?
- [ ] Are my volume swells smooth and musical?
- [ ] Does the folk melody come through clearly?
- [ ] Is the texture interesting without being busy?

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# CHAPTER 9: ENTANGLED HORIZONS {#chapter-9-entangled-horizons}

**Style**: Ant Law Style | **Key**: E Minor | **Tempo**: 120 BPM | **Time**: 4/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-8}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Play the head with rhythmic displacement
- [ ] Comp through the form with modern voicings
- [ ] Execute triad weaving with smooth voice leading
- [ ] Use hybrid picking for clarity

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 72 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 96 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 120 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If displacement is disorienting, play phrases on the beat first, then gradually shift.

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Rhythmic displacement, modern extensions. Complex on paper, natural in practice."*

Entangled Horizons takes Ant Law's approach: precise rhythmic displacement, modern extensions, and a feeling of interlocking patterns. It's intricate—but the goal is for the complexity to feel inevitable, not forced.

**Playing Tip**: Keep your internal pulse rock-solid. The displacement should feel intentional.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-8}

- [ ] Can I feel beat 1 while playing displaced phrases?
- [ ] Is my hybrid picking clean?
- [ ] Do the modern voicings sound intentional, not random?
- [ ] Is there groove despite the complexity?

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# CHAPTER 10: FRACTURED LIGHT {#chapter-10-fractured-light}

**Style**: Ant Law Style (7/4) | **Key**: F# Minor | **Tempo**: 140 BPM | **Time**: 7/4

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-9}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Feel 7/4 naturally (as 4+3 or 3+4)
- [ ] Play the head from memory in correct meter
- [ ] Comp through the form without losing beat 1
- [ ] Execute triads that emphasize the 7/4 subdivisions

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 84 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 112 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 140 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If 7/4 feels impossible, count aloud "1-2-3-4, 1-2-3" repeatedly until it becomes natural.

---

## OVERVIEW

*"Seven beats, one unified groove. For when you're ready to leave 4/4 behind."*

Fractured Light lives in 7/4—an asymmetric meter that feels strange until it doesn't. The title evokes light refracted through a prism: bent, but coherent. Once the meter clicks, this tune grooves hard.

**Playing Tip**: Pick ONE subdivision (4+3 or 3+4) and commit completely.

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-9}

- [ ] Does 7/4 feel natural, or am I counting?
- [ ] Can I find beat 1 reliably?
- [ ] Is there groove despite the odd meter?
- [ ] Do the triads emphasize the subdivision structure?

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# CHAPTER 11: GREEZY {#chapter-11-greezy}

**Style**: Grant Green Style | **Key**: G Major | **Tempo**: 100 BPM | **Time**: 12/8

---

## MINIMUM VIABLE GIG (MVG) {#minimum-viable-gig-mvg-10}

**Ready-Set Checklist**:
- [ ] Feel the 12/8 shuffle naturally
- [ ] Play the head with bluesy phrasing
- [ ] Comp through the form with shuffle pattern
- [ ] Use diminished passing chords as connectors

**Tempo Milestones**:
- 60% = 60 BPM (learning tempo)
- 80% = 80 BPM (practice tempo)
- 100% = 100 BPM (performance tempo)

**Fallback Route**: If the diminished substitutions are hard, play a straight blues (I-IV-V) and add diminished later.

---

## OVERVIEW {#overview-11}

*"Traditional shuffle with modern diminished substitutions."*

Greezy is the greasiest tune in the collection—a down-home blues shuffle in 12/8 with modern harmonic twists. The diminished substitutions add unexpected color while keeping the deep blues feel intact.

**Playing Tip**: Lock with the imaginary drummer's triplet feel. Feel the grease.

---

## THE FORM {#the-form-11}

12-bar blues with diminished substitutions:

```
| G7       | C7       | G7       | G7  G#dim7 |
| C7       | C#dim7   | G7       | E7         |
| Am7      | D7#9     | G7  E7   | Am7  D7    |
```

---

## SELF-EVALUATION {#self-evaluation-11}

- [ ] Is my shuffle feel solid and relaxed?
- [ ] Do I use the diminished chords as connectors?
- [ ] Are my bends in tune and expressive?
- [ ] Does it feel "greezy"?

# LEVEL 3: THE MIRROR {#level-3-the-mirror}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

The Mirror is a study in patience. Level 3 asks you to stop thinking about what notes to play and start thinking about where the harmony wants to go. Every chord in this tune exists in relationship to Ab major—even the distant bridge chords (Bmaj7, Emaj7) function as upper-structure tension pulling back toward home.

Your job at this level is to feel the gravity.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

The A section moves gently outward from Ab major, touching Fm (the relative minor), Dbmaj7 (the IV chord), and returning home. The motion is circular, not linear—you're never far from where you started.

The B section is the departure. Bmaj7 and Emaj7 sit a tritone away from the home key. These chords don't resolve traditionally—they float, creating tension that releases only when you return to the A' section. Feel this: the bridge is suspense, not resolution.

The A' section brings you back, but with the Dbmaj9 → Dbm turn in bar 15. This is the emotional heart of the tune—the major chord turning minor, a moment of melancholy before the final resolution.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shell voicings, notice which notes stay still and which notes move.

- The 3rd of Abmaj (C) moves by step to the 3rd of Fm (Ab)—this is smooth
- The 7th of one chord often becomes the 3rd of the next—trace these connections
- In the bridge, the roots move chromatically while upper voices hold—feel the bass moving underneath stable chord tones

The goal is to hear voice-leading in real time, not to think about it consciously.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The form is AABA, but the second A is subtly different from the first. Notice the Gbmaj7 in bar 7—this is modal interchange (borrowed from Ab Dorian). It colors the return without disrupting the flow.

The B section is exactly four bars—short but harmonically distant. The A' section resolves all tension and closes on the tonic.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form slowly, feeling the pull toward Ab major at all times
2. In the bridge, notice how the tension builds with each chord
3. At the Dbmaj9 → Dbm moment in bar 15, slow down—feel the melancholy
4. End on Ab and let it ring. The tune should feel complete.

Do not add complexity. Use only the shells. Let the harmony speak.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# LEVEL 3: CRYSTAL SILENCE {#level-3-crystal-silence}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Crystal Silence is about sustain and space. At Level 3, your focus shifts from what notes ring to how long they ring and how they overlap. The harmony here is gentle—there are no jarring shifts. But that gentleness requires attention. Without awareness, the tune becomes static.

Your job is to shape the sustain into direction.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

The home key is A major, and most of the tune stays close to that tonal center. The F#m and Bm chords are natural extensions of the key. The Dmaj9 is the IV chord, bright and stable.

The surprise is bars 9-10: Fmaj7 → Gmaj7. These are borrowed from A minor (or more precisely, from the parallel modes). They create a brief excursion—a cloud passing over the sun—before the return to Amaj9 in bar 11.

Feel the return. The whole tune pivots around that moment.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, the voice-leading is particularly smooth in this tune. Many notes stay still while one voice moves by step.

- The 3rd of Amaj (C#) moves to the root of F#m (F#) by fifth—but the E and B stay still
- In the Fmaj7 → Gmaj7 → Amaj9 progression, the roots rise by step while the quality shifts

The shells make this visible. Play slowly and watch each voice.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The form is 16 bars, through-composed but with clear sectional behavior:
- Bars 1-8: Home territory
- Bars 9-10: Modal excursion
- Bars 11-16: Return and extended cadence

The last two bars (both Amaj9) are a rest—time for the sound to decay into silence. Don't rush the ending.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play the form and let each chord ring as long as possible
2. At bars 9-10, feel the shift—something changes, even if it's subtle
3. At bar 11, feel the relief of returning to Amaj9
4. Hold the final chord and listen to it decay

The tune is complete when the last sound fades to silence.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# LEVEL 3: ORBIT {#level-3-orbit}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Orbit is non-functional. The chords don't resolve in traditional ways—they float, orbit, circle around each other. At Level 3, you stop expecting resolution and start hearing relationship. Each chord is a satellite; F major is the planet they orbit.

Your job is to feel the gravitational field without expecting arrival.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

The home chord is Fmaj7#11, but "home" here means something different than in traditional harmony. The tune keeps touching Fmaj7 (bars 1, 9, 13, 16) like a returning orbit, but it never cadences strongly.

The root motion is chromatic: F → Eb → Db → B. This descending chromatic line creates direction without function. You're not going somewhere—you're falling slowly.

Notice the symmetry: the tune is palindromic in feel, though not exactly in chords. What goes down must come up, eventually.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, watch the 7ths. In this tune, the major 7th is almost always present—it's the defining color.

- The 7th of Fmaj (E) moves to the 7th of Ebmaj (D)—descending by step
- This pattern repeats throughout: the 7th descends while the root descends

Feel this as a long, slow sigh.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The 3/4 meter is crucial. The waltz creates a lilting, circular feel that reinforces the "orbit" concept. Don't play in 3/4 like it's truncated 4/4—feel the spinning motion.

The form is 16 bars, but because of 3/4, it feels shorter. The tune is compact, self-contained, and deliberately mysterious.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form in 3/4, feeling the lilt
2. Notice each time you return to Fmaj7—it's a touchstone, not a resolution
3. Feel the descending chromatic motion in the bass
4. Let each chord float—don't try to make it resolve

The tune ends on Fmaj7, but it doesn't feel like an ending. It feels like another orbit about to begin.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# LEVEL 3: PARALLAX {#level-3-parallax}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Parallax is grounded in the blues. Despite the chromatic complexity, the tune is built on a Bb dominant foundation. At Level 3, you learn to hear the blues underneath everything—the chromatic approaches, the extended harmonies, the Scofield angularity. The blues is the constant; everything else is decoration.

Your job is to never lose the root.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

Bb7 is home. Everything pulls toward it. The Eb7 is the IV chord—bluesy and expected. The F7 is the V chord, creating traditional dominant motion.

The secondary chords (Gm7, Cm7, Em7b5) add color but don't change the fundamental gravity. You're always heading back to Bb7.

The chromatic approaches that define the Scofield style work *because* the harmonic gravity is so strong. You can get far out because the pull back is reliable.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, the dominant 7th sound is central. The b7 (Ab in Bb7) is what gives the chord its character.

- Bb7's b7 (Ab) moves to Eb7's root (Eb)—this is the blues motion
- The 3rd of Bb7 (D) stays put or moves to the 7th of Eb7 (Db)

These movements are smooth despite the funky surface. Feel the logic underneath.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The 32-bar form is divided into four 8-bar sections:
- Section 1: Intro, establishing Bb7
- Section 2: The form opens up (Gm7, Cm7)
- Section 3: Quartal density
- Section 4: Outro, back to basics

Each section has a different character, but Bb7 anchors all of them.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form and feel the pull to Bb7
2. At every chord change, know how you're getting back to Bb7
3. Accent the groove—this tune needs attitude even in shell voicings
4. End on Bb7 with conviction

The blues is the foundation. Everything else is style.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# LEVEL 3: FIRST LIGHT {#level-3-first-light}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

First Light is about phrasing over time. The harmony is warm and supportive—major 9ths, Lydian extensions, gentle motion. At Level 3, you're not learning new materials; you're learning to shape existing materials into long, breathing arcs.

Your job is to play the phrase, not the chord.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

G major is home, and the tune rarely strays far. The IV chord (Cmaj9 with Lydian color) is a bright expansion. The ii chord (Am9) is a gentle pull. The V chord (D9) resolves smoothly home.

This is functional harmony, beautifully voiced. The gravity is clear—use it to shape your lines.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, the voice-leading is exceptionally smooth. Many movements are by step or by common tone.

- The 3rd of Gmaj (B) is the 5th of Em—it can stay still
- The 7th of Am (G) is the root of G—another common tone

These connections are the secret to Metheny's flowing sound. Don't jump when you can step.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The 32-bar form feels like four 8-bar phrases, each one a complete musical sentence. The first phrase establishes home. The second expands outward. The third builds tension. The fourth resolves and closes.

Breathe at the end of each 8 bars. The form should feel like speaking, not reading.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form in long phrases (8 bars each)
2. Breathe naturally—if you're holding your breath, slow down
3. Feel the resolution at the end of each 8-bar phrase
4. At the final Gmaj9, let it ring like sunrise

First light is gentle. Your playing should be too.

# LEVEL 3: ANGULAR MOTION {#level-3-angular-motion}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Angular Motion is fast, but speed is not the point. At Level 3, you're thinking about direction through changes—how each chord pulls to the next, how bebop voice-leading creates forward momentum. The shells may be static, but the intent behind them should be linear.

Your job is to feel the line even when playing chords.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

Gb major is the home key, and the AABA form creates strong pull toward Gb at the end of each A section. The bridge (B section) provides contrast and creates tension that resolves when A returns.

The bebop substitutions (diminished passing chords, chromatic approaches) all reinforce the underlying functional harmony. They're decorations on a solid structure.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, notice the chromatic movement in inner voices. Bebop harmony is full of half-step motion—the shells reveal this clearly.

- The 3rd of one chord often becomes the 7th of the next (or vice versa)
- Roots frequently move by fifth or by chromatic step

At tempo, you won't think about this consciously. But the patterns should be in your hands.

---

**Structural Awareness**

AABA means 8+8+8+8. Each A section establishes home; the B section departs and returns. The final A is the payoff—everything before it is preparation.

Even at 200 BPM, feel the architecture. Speed without structure is noise.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form at SLOW tempo first (80-100 BPM)
2. Feel the pull toward Gb at the end of each A section
3. Notice the chromatic voice-leading in the shells
4. Gradually increase tempo while maintaining structural awareness

Speed is the last thing you add. Everything else comes first.

# LEVEL 3: BLUE CYCLE {#level-3-blue-cycle}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Blue Cycle is a blues—don't forget this. The reharmonization adds color, but the 12-bar form and the I-IV-V logic are still present underneath. At Level 3, you're learning to hear the simple within the complex.

Your job is to play modern voicings with blues intent.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

Bb7 is I. Eb7 is IV. F7 is V. This is the blues.

The modern substitutions (Barry Harris 6th diminished, altered dominants, tritone subs) are all in service of this basic framework. The turnaround (bars 9-12) is where the complexity peaks, but it still resolves to I.

Feel the blues. The harmony is just clothing.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, the blues movement is clear:

- I to IV: Bb7 to Eb7 (the root rises a fourth)
- IV to I: Eb7 to Bb7 (the root falls a fourth)
- V to I: F7 to Bb7 (the classic resolution)

The modern voicings add inner-voice movement, but the bass motion is pure blues.

---

**Structural Awareness**

12-bar blues has a natural narrative:
- Bars 1-4: Statement (I chord territory)
- Bars 5-6: Response (IV chord)
- Bars 7-8: Return (I chord)
- Bars 9-12: Turnaround (the tension-resolution arc)

Know where you are in this story at all times.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form and feel the blues underneath
2. Simplify to I-IV-V if the subs get confusing
3. In the turnaround, feel the buildup and resolution
4. End on Bb7 like you mean it

It's still the blues. Don't lose that.

# LEVEL 3: HARMOLODIC SKETCH {#level-3-harmolodic-sketch}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Harmolodic Sketch is about texture, not progression. The harmony is simple (G major folk chords), but the way you voice them and the space you leave between them creates the music. At Level 3, you're thinking about color, sustain, and silence.

Your job is to make simple chords say something.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

G major is home. The progression is almost entirely diatonic: G, C, D, Em, Am. There are no surprises harmonically.

The interest comes from how you play these chords—open voicings, volume swells, notes that ring into each other. The gravity is gentle and constant.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, there's barely any voice-leading to speak of—the chords are so simple that voice movement is minimal.

This is the point. When harmony is static, texture becomes paramount. The shells are placeholders; your touch and timing are the music.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The 32-bar form is divided into phrases, but the phrase boundaries are softer than in other tunes. The music flows continuously, more like a Frisell improvisation than a composed head.

Let the form breathe. Don't impose structure; follow it.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form very slowly
2. Leave space—at least one beat of silence between chords
3. Use volume swells: pick with the volume down, then bring it up
4. Let the final G chord decay completely

In this tune, less is more. Trust the space.

# LEVEL 3: ENTANGLED HORIZONS {#level-3-entangled-horizons}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Entangled Horizons is about rhythmic precision within harmonic complexity. The modern voicings and displaced phrases require a solid internal pulse. At Level 3, you're learning to hold two things at once: the steady beat underneath and the syncopated material on top.

Your job is to be in two places at once.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

E minor is the home key, but "home" feels more like a gravitational field than a destination. The harmony is modal and modern—quartal voicings, suspended sounds, extensions that blur chord identity.

The pull toward E minor is constant but gentle. You feel it more than you hear it.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, the voice-leading is often quartal—voices move in parallel fourths rather than traditional thirds. This creates a modern, ambiguous sound.

Watch for:
- Root movement by fourth (E → A → D)
- Parallel motion in upper voices
- Suspended sounds that don't resolve traditionally

The shells reveal the modern voice-leading clearly.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The 32-bar form has clear sections, but the rhythmic displacement makes phrase boundaries harder to feel. Your job is to know where beat 1 is at all times, even when you're playing off it.

The form is the anchor. Displacement is the decoration.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Play through the form with a metronome clicking on beat 1 only
2. Feel where each chord lands relative to beat 1
3. Notice the quartal voice-leading in the shells
4. Keep your foot tapping even when your hands are displaced

The complexity is rhythmic, not harmonic. Master the rhythm first.

# LEVEL 3: FRACTURED LIGHT {#level-3-fractured-light}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Fractured Light is in 7/4. At Level 3, you're not counting anymore—you're feeling the meter as a single unit, a seven-beat groove that has its own internal logic. The harmony is secondary; the meter is primary.

Your job is to make 7 feel like 1.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

F# minor is the home key. The harmony is modal and dark—minor voicings, half-diminished sounds, altered tensions. The gravity is minor-key gravity: heavy, pulling downward.

The 7/4 meter reinforces this darkness. Odd meters often feel unresolved, and this tune leans into that quality.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, the voice-leading serves the meter. Chord changes often fall on specific beats within the 7/4 bar—these placements reinforce the subdivision (4+3 or 3+4).

Feel how the voice changes align with the metric structure. The harmony and the rhythm are working together.

---

**Structural Awareness**

The 28-bar form (4 × 7 bars) creates a symmetrical structure within the asymmetric meter. Each 7-bar phrase is a complete musical thought.

Count the phrases, not the beats. Once you're thinking in 7-bar phrases, the form becomes clear.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Walk in 7/4 (4 steps + 3 steps, or 3 + 4)
2. Tap the shell voicings while walking
3. Feel where beat 1 falls in each bar
4. Play the form as four 7-bar phrases

The meter is everything. Get it in your body first, then add harmony.

# LEVEL 3: GREEZY {#level-3-greezy}

## Harmonic Navigation & Voice-Leading Summary

---

**Purpose of Level 3 for This Tune**

Greezy is the blues at its most elemental. At Level 3, you're not adding complexity—you're stripping it away. The 12/8 shuffle, the simple I-IV-V, the greasy feel: this is the foundation everything else is built on.

Your job is to groove.

---

**Harmonic Gravity and Direction**

G7 is I. C7 is IV. D7 is V. This is the blues, unchanged since the beginning.

The diminished passing chords (G#dim7, C#dim7) are classic blues devices—chromatic connectors that have been used for a hundred years. They add motion without changing the fundamental harmony.

The gravity here is the strongest in the book. Everything pulls to G7.

---

**Voice-Leading Intent**

In your Level 2 shells, the blues voice-leading is pure:

- G7 to C7: the root rises, the 7th becomes the 3rd
- C7 to G7: the reverse
- D7 to G7: the classic V-I resolution

These movements are in every blues ever played. The shells make them visible.

---

**Structural Awareness**

12-bar blues is the most familiar structure in jazz. You should be able to feel where you are without thinking.

- Bars 1-4: Home (G7)
- Bars 5-6: Movement (C7)
- Bars 7-8: Return (G7)
- Bars 9-10: Tension (Am7, D7)
- Bars 11-12: Resolution (back to G7)

This is the story. Tell it with conviction.

---

**Practice Guidance**

Using your Level 2 shell voicings:

1. Feel the triplet subdivision in your body before you play
2. Play behind the beat—not late, but relaxed
3. Let the diminished chords slide by like passing notes
4. End on G7 like you're home after a long journey

The blues is the foundation. This tune is where it all comes together.

# GLOSSARY {#glossary}

This glossary defines specialist terms as used throughout this book.

---

**Altered Dominant**: A dominant 7th chord with chromatic alterations (b9, #9, b5/#11, b13). Creates maximum tension before resolution.

**Bebop Scale**: An 8-note scale created by adding a chromatic passing tone to a standard 7-note scale, ensuring chord tones land on downbeats.

**Campanella**: Italian for "little bell." A technique where notes on different strings ring into each other, creating overlapping sustain.

**Chromatic Approach**: Approaching a target note from a half step above or below.

**Contrary Motion**: Two voices moving in opposite directions—when one ascends, the other descends.

**Diminished Passing Chord**: A diminished 7th chord used to connect two chords chromatically (e.g., G#dim7 between G7 and Am7).

**Dorian Mode**: The second mode of the major scale. Minor quality with a natural 6th. Used extensively on minor 7th chords.

**Drop-2 Voicing**: A four-note chord voicing created by dropping the second voice from the top down an octave.

**ECM Aesthetic**: The spacious, reverberant sound associated with the ECM record label. Characterized by space, dynamics, and minimal ornamentation.

**Economy Picking**: A picking technique that combines alternate picking with sweep picking for efficiency across strings.

**Harmolodic**: Ornette Coleman's concept where melody, harmony, and rhythm are given equal importance.

**Hybrid Picking**: Using the pick for bass notes while fingers (m, a) play higher strings simultaneously.

**Lydian Mode**: The fourth mode of the major scale. Major quality with a raised 4th (#11). Creates a "floating" sound on major chords.

**Mixolydian Mode**: The fifth mode of the major scale. Major quality with a flatted 7th. The primary scale for dominant 7th chords.

**Modal Interchange**: Borrowing chords from parallel modes (e.g., using Fmaj7 from A minor in a piece in A major).

**Non-functional Harmony**: Chord progressions that move by interval relationship rather than traditional resolution (V-I).

**Quartal Voicing**: Chords built in stacked 4ths rather than 3rds. Creates an open, modern sound.

**Rhythmic Displacement**: Shifting a phrase to start on an unexpected beat, creating tension with the underlying pulse.

**Shell Voicing**: A minimal chord voicing containing only root, 3rd, and 7th.

**Triad Pair**: Two triads used together over a single chord to create melodic material. The "stable" triad outlines the chord; the "color" triad adds extensions.

**Tritone**: An interval of three whole steps (augmented 4th or diminished 5th). Maximum dissonance.

**Voice Leading**: The smooth movement of individual voices from chord to chord, minimizing motion.

**Volume Swell**: Picking a note with volume at zero and gradually increasing it, creating a "fade in" effect.
