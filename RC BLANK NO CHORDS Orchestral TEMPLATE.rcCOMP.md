Create a new orchestral score based on the “RC BLANK Orchestral TEMPLATE.rcCOMP,” but modify it so every part contains only a single C major chord, sustained or repeated as simple whole notes, with no other chord, harmony, or progression in any instrument.

Rename it “RC BLANK NO CHORDS Orchestral TEMPLATE.rcCOMP”

- Do not introduce any chord changes, tensions, modulations, or progressions.
- Use only the pitch content and voicing of C major—do not suggest a functional tonic or create any leading tones (for example, avoid using G or F chords, and don’t use secondary dominants or modal shifts).
- The result should be harmonically static and as “blank” as possible, simply holding a C chord throughout, so composers can freely build new harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic structures from scratch.
- No melody, counterpoint, or rhythmic figures—just a flat C chord in every part, for as many bars/measures as needed to demonstrate.
