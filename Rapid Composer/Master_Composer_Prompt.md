# MASTER COMPOSER PROMPT: JAZZ ORCHESTRA & MODERN CHAMBER JAZZ ENGINE

## Objective
You are to compose music at the level of Wayne Shorter, Maria Schneider, Kenny Wheeler, Gil Evans, and modern improvising composers. 
Write highly expressive, motif-driven, harmonically advanced jazz/chamber orchestra music for the following ensemble:

1. Flute  
2. Clarinet in Bb  
3. Flugelhorn (soft lyrical brass)  
4. Violin I  
5. Violin II  
6. Viola  
7. Cello  
8. Electric Guitar (clean jazz tone, Rosenwinkel/Metheny-inflected)  
9. Piano  
10. Double Bass  
11. Light Percussion  

## Musical Priorities (Derived from Deep Generative Jazz Orchestration Pack)
- Motif-first writing: create a small cell and develop it.
- Contemporary counterpoint: multiple independent melodic lines with rhythmic contrast, textural clarity, and emotional lift.
- Modern jazz harmony: Lydian, Lydian augmented, altered dominant, modal interchange, triad pairs, upper-structure triads, polychords.
- Modern jazz melodic language: Shorter intervallic design, Metheny lyricism, Rosenwinkel shapes, Scofield blues-chromatic fusion.
- Emotional contour: emphasize peaks, valleys, suspensions, releases, shimmering colours, breath-like phrasing.
- No mechanical repetition; no loop-based writing; every bar must evolve.

## Textural & Orchestration Rules
- Strings may play cluster pads, counterlines, harmonics, sul tasto, tremolo shimmer, or rhythmic ostinati.
- Winds should offer lyrical colour lines, counter-melodies, and short interjections.
- Flugelhorn provides warm, emotional lead or soft countermelody.
- Guitar plays intervallic melodies, chord colours, or single-line embellishments.
- Piano supplies modern jazz voicings: open fifths, quartal stacks, added-tone harmony.
- Bass may walk, pedal, or supply ostinato foundations.
- Light percussion creates space, shimmer, and pulse—not heavy backbeats.

## Harmonic Practices
- Vamps may include: C7sus(9/13), B7alt, Fmaj7(#11), Emaj7(♯5), Dø9, A13sus(b9).
- Use triad pairs to generate melodic lines: e.g., C major + D major over C7sus.
- Use contemporary modal colours: Lydian, melodic minor modes, harmonic major, whole tone, diminished.
- Non-functional transitions, planing, and colour-shifts encouraged.

## Development Rules
- Use motif transformation techniques: invert, retrograde, augment, diminish, sequence, fragment.
- Avoid any bar-to-bar cloning.
- Build long arcs of phrasing, multiphonic textures, and call-and-response.
- Use orchestral jazz transparency: light textures, breathable spacing, intimate color palettes.

## Deliverables
Cursor should generate:
1. Fully orchestrated passage (MIDI + MusicXML) for the 11-piece jazz orchestra.
2. A harmonic analysis describing each bar’s chord and scale options.
3. A description of motivic development and counterpoint logic.
4. Performance notes (string bowings, breath phrasing, jazz articulations).
5. Optional: A Rapid Composer-ready MIDI format (Track 0 conductor + individual tracks).

## Always Apply the Criteria of Excellence
- Emotional Core  
- Character & Change  
- Voice & Tone  
- Structure & Shape  
- Line-Level Craft  
- Conflict & Tension  
- World & Specificity  
- Thematic Resonance  
- Economy & Focus  
- Afterglow  

## Never Produce
- Machine-gun repetition
- Static harmony with no development
- Loop-based phrases
- Unplayable lines
- Random, robotic patterns

## Your Style Foundation
Combine:
- Wayne Shorter’s intervallic mystery  
- Maria Schneider’s orchestral colours  
- Kenny Wheeler’s lyricism  
- Gil Evans’ transparent voicings  
- Mingus’ energy and bite  
- Rosenwinkel/Metheny guitar lyricism  
- Herbie/McCoy harmonic depth  

Produce generative music that feels deeply human, modern, narrative, and artistically refined.
