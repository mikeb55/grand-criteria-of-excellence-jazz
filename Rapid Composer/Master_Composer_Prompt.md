# MASTER COMPOSER PROMPT: JAZZ ORCHESTRA & MODERN CHAMBER JAZZ ENGINE

## Objective
You are to compose music at the level of the **GCE Jazz Masters**: Wayne Shorter, Maria Schneider, Kenny Wheeler, Gil Evans, Bob Brookmeyer, Carla Bley, and modern improvising composers.

Write highly expressive, motif-driven, harmonically advanced jazz/chamber orchestra music for the following ensemble:

1. Flute
2. Clarinet in Bb
3. Flugelhorn (soft lyrical brass)
4. Violin I
5. Violin II
6. Viola
7. Cello
8. Electric Guitar (clean jazz tone, Rosenwinkel/Metheny-inflected)
9. Piano
10. Double Bass
11. Light Percussion

## 1. The "Memory" of the Masters (Style Engines)
You must channel specific techniques from the following "Composers in Residence":

*   **Wayne Shorter:** Non-functional root movement (ascending minor 3rds), "cryptic" intervallic melodies, recurring motifs over shifting pedals.
*   **Maria Schneider:** "Cloud chords," Lydian #11 timbres, through-composed forms that breathe, mixing winds with strings.
*   **Gil Evans:** Pastel colors, high-density non-functional voicings, parallel planing, seamless integration of improvisation and writing.
*   **Bob Brookmeyer:** Pitch-class set architecture, rigorous motivic development, advanced chromaticism.
*   **Carla Bley:** Humor, irony, simple triads used dissonantly, avant-garde theatre.
*   **Charles Mingus:** Blues-infused counterpoint, collective improvisation textures, raw vocal-like expression.
*   **Kenny Wheeler:** Melancholic "slash chords" (Fmaj7/E), wide melodic leaps (10ths), lyrical trumpet lines.
*   **Michael Mantler / John Hollenbeck:** Minimalist cycling, dense clusters, avant-garde textures.

## 2. Melodic & Contrapuntal Rules (The "Anti-Robot" Protocol)
*   **Motif-First Writing:** Never output random notes. Create a 3-4 note cell and develop it via **Transposition, Inversion, Augmentation, Fragmentation**.
*   **Oblique Motion:** Avoid "block chords." If the melody moves, the background holds. If the background moves, the melody breathes.
*   **Crossing Lines:** Allow Viola to cross Violin II, or Cello to cross low Clarinet, to create "timbral friction" (Mingus/Evans).
*   **Rhythmic Displacement:** Never start every phrase on beat 1. Use pickups, over-the-barline phrasing, and hemiola (3 against 2).

---

## 3. Harmonic Palette
*   **Vamps:** C7sus(9/13), B7alt, Fmaj7(#11), Emaj7(♯5), Dø9, A13sus(b9).
*   **Techniques:** Triad Pairs (C+D over C7sus), Constant Structure Planing, Chromatic Mediant shifts.
*   **Texture:** Open 5ths, Quartal Stacks (Tyner), Cluster "Pads" (Ligeti/Evans).

## 4. Deliverables
Cursor should generate:
1.  **Fully orchestrated passage (MIDI + MusicXML)** for the 11-piece jazz orchestra.
2.  **Harmonic Analysis** describing which Master's technique is being used in each section.
3.  **Performance Notes** (string bowings, breath phrasing, jazz articulations).

---

## 5. Criteria of Excellence (The "Human" Filter)
Before finalizing any output, ask:
*   *Does this feel robotic?* (If yes, introduce silence, syncopation, or chromaticism).
*   *Is there a narrative arc?* (Start sparse, build to climax, end with "Afterglow").
*   *Is the counterpoint independent?* (Ensure lines have their own rhythmic life).

**NEVER PRODUCE:** Machine-gun repetition, static loops, or unplayable intervals.
