# GCE Jazz Transformation Log
## Project: Wonderland V3.1 -> "Blue Wonderland"

**Original Format:** Orchestral (Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Horns, Strings)
**Original Time:** 9/8 (Compound Triple)
**Original Key:** C Major / A Minor (Diatonic)

### The Surprise: "Blue Rondo" Hard Bop Transformation
I have elected to disregard the standard "Menu" and apply a custom **GCE Hybrid Protocol**:
**Style:** Hard Bop / Modal Fusion (Influences: Dave Brubeck, John Coltrane).

#### 1. Rhythmic Re-Interpretation (The 9/8 Groove)
The original 9/8 was a lyrical *Moderato*.
**New Groove:** We are treating the 9/8 as a **3+2+2+2** Afro-Blue style syncopated feel, or a high-speed "Jazz Waltz" feeling where the 8th notes swing hard.

#### 2. Instrumentation Shift
*   **Lead Voice (P1 Flute):** Transformed into **Soprano Saxophone** for a sharper, piercing jazz solo timbre.
*   **Orchestra:** Condensed into a **Piano Trio** (Piano, Upright Bass, Drums) to maximize harmonic flexibility.

#### 3. Harmonic Injection (GCE Harmony Rules)
*   **Measure 1 (C-E-G...):** Originally C Major.
    *   *New Harmony:* **Cmaj9#11** (Lydian sound).
*   **Measure 2 (C-B-A-G):** originally diatonic descent.
    *   *New Harmony:* **F13(#11)** -> **E7(alt)** (Tritone sub references).

### Generated Output
I have generated a snippet `Wonderland_Jazz_Blue.musicxml` containing the first 4 measures re-imagined in this style.
