# Concert Dual – Corrective Instruction Block v1.2

## Scope
This document defines the non-negotiable rules for generating
**Concert Dual** lead sheets in the Parallax collection.

These rules override default AI behaviour.

A Concert Dual chart is **not** lead + comp.
It is **chamber counterpoint for two equal voices**.

---

## 1. Global Definition (Non-Negotiable)

- Trumpet and guitar are **independent melodic voices**
- Harmony is **implied through motion**, not delivered through chords
- Restraint means **active inner motion**, not inactivity

If either part can be removed without harming the music,
the result has failed.

---

## 2. Guitar Role (Critical Override)

The guitar is a **second melodic consciousness**, not an accompaniment instrument.

### Mandatory Behaviour
- Primarily **single-note lines**
- Continuous low-level motion preferred to sustained harmony
- Imply bass movement and inner voice-leading
- Use silence deliberately, never by default

### Explicit Prohibitions
- No repeated strummed or block chord shapes
- No multi-bar sustained shell voicings
- No comping patterns
- No rhythmic mirroring of the trumpet beyond one bar

---

## 3. Chordal Colour Rule (Essential Clarification)

Double-stops and triads are **allowed only as melodic colour**,
not as harmony delivery.

### Definition
Chordal figures function as **events**, not texture.

### Rules
- May appear:
  - at phrase peaks
  - at moments of emotional emphasis
  - briefly at structural arrivals
- Must:
  - be short in duration
  - dissolve immediately back into single-note motion
  - never repeat as a pattern

### Forbidden
- Chordal repetition
- Multi-bar chordal textures
- Chords used to “hold” harmony

Think: **a flash of harmony, not a bed of harmony**.

---

## 4. Trumpet Role

- Often the foreground voice, but not always
- Phrasing should be **asymmetrical and inward**
- Avoid predictable 2- or 4-bar phrase structures
- Motivic material may return altered, displaced, or fragmented

---

## 5. Interaction Rules (Mandatory)

At least one must occur in every section:
- Delayed guitar response to trumpet phrases
- Overlapping phrases
- Trumpet sustains while guitar moves
- Guitar sustains briefly while trumpet moves
- Oblique or contrary motion at cadences

Parallel politeness = failure.

---

## 6. Harmonic Behaviour

- Avoid clear or early harmonic resolution
- Let harmony feel **revealed gradually**
- Guide-tone drift and stepwise motion preferred
- Chord symbols are informational only
  and must not dictate guitar behaviour

If harmony feels “clear” too quickly, it is incorrect.

---

## 7. Guitar Physical Constraints

Unless explicitly overridden:
- Primary register: frets **5–9**
- Preferred string sets: **5–3** and **4–2**
- Minimal position shifts within sections

---

## 8. Final Quality Gate (Fail Fast)

Before accepting a chart, confirm:
1. The guitar part makes musical sense alone
2. Harmony is implied even if chord symbols are hidden
3. The duo feels incomplete if either voice is removed

If any answer is “no”, regenerate.
