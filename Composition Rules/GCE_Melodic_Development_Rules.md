# Deep Generative Jazz Orchestration Research Guide

This document serves as a core rule set for generative outputs in the GCE Jazz workflow. It mandates adherence to advanced melodic development, contemporary counterpoint, and orchestration techniques derived from master jazz composers.

## 1. Melodic Development Rules
*   **Core Principle:** "Start with melody—make it memorable, and use steps, skips, and leaps."
*   **Development Techniques:**
    *   **Repetition & Transposition:** Repeat motifs but shift them to new harmonic centers (Shorter style).
    *   **Inversion & Retrograde:** Flip the contour or play it backward to create organic variation.
    *   **Augmentation & Diminution:** Stretch or compress the rhythmic duration of the motif.
    *   **Fragmentation:** Break the motif into smaller cells and use them as rhythmic stabs or echoes.
*   **Expressive Devices:**
    *   **Chromatic Enclosure:** Surround target notes with chromatic neighbors.
    *   **Rhythmic Displacement:** Shift phrases across the bar line to avoid static "on-the-beat" phrasing.
    *   **Ghost Notes & Scoops:** (Implied in MIDI velocity/CC) Use subtle dynamic dips and bends.

## 2. Contemporary Counterpoint Rules
*   **Reference Models:** Gerry Mulligan Quartet, Charles Mingus, Kenny Wheeler ("Who Are You"), Maria Schneider.
*   **Actionable Logic:**
    *   **Independence:** Avoid "block chord" movement where all voices move in the same rhythm.
    *   **Oblique Motion:** One voice moves while another holds a pedal or long tone.
    *   **Crossing Lines:** Allow lines to cross ranges to create timbral friction (e.g., Viola crossing above Violin II).
    *   **Rhythmic Contrast:** If the melody is active (8th notes), the counter-melody should be slow (whole/half notes) or rhythmic stabs.

## 3. Orchestration & Texture
*   **Layering:**
    *   **Foreground:** Primary Melody (Winds/Brass).
    *   **Midground:** Active Counterpoint (Strings/Guitar).
    *   **Background:** Harmonic Foundation (Bass/Piano/Pad).
*   **Timbral Contrast:**
    *   Mix "Dry" sounds (Plucked Guitar, Pizzicato) with "Wet" sounds (Flute, Bowed Strings).
    *   Use register extremes (Low Flute vs High Bass) for color.

## 4. Resources & Study Path
*   **Berklee Press:** "Contemporary Counterpoint" – Practical exercises for jazz ensemble writing.
*   **Alan Belkin:** "The Craft and Art of Musical Composition" – Focus on motivic coherence.
*   **Listening/Score Study:**
    *   **Wayne Shorter:** For non-functional harmonic melody.
    *   **Maria Schneider:** For Lydian/Pastel textures and through-composed forms.
    *   **Kenny Wheeler:** For melancholic, wide-interval melodies.
    *   **Charles Mingus:** For raw, blues-infused counterpoint.

**Implementation Note:** All future Python generation scripts and AI prompts must cross-reference these rules to ensuring outputs are not merely "correct" but musically sophisticated and emotionally resonant.
